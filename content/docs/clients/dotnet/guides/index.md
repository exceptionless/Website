This section will provide you with specific guides for setting up and configuring Exceptionless with the most used and current .NET platforms Exceptionless supports. To see the full list of supported platforms, see our [Supported Platforms documentation](../supported-platforms.md).

Exceptionless tries to provide support for platforms as long as Microsoft supports them. As such, you will be able to utilize any of our packages for your applications, but this documentation will focus on our core packages for .NET.
