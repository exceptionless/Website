## About

[Read about client configuration and view in-depth examples](../../project-settings.md)

## Usage Example

The below example demonstrates **how we would turn on or off log event submissions at runtime** without redeploying the app or changing server config settings.

First, we add a (completely arbitrary for this example) `enableLogSubmission` client configuration value key with value `true` in the Project's Settings in the Exceptionless dashboard.

Then, we register a new client side plugin that runs each time an event is created. If our key (`enableLogSubmission`) is set to false and the event type is set to log, we will discard the event.

```csharp
ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.AddPlugin("Conditionally cancel log submission", 100, context => {
    var enableLogSubmission = context.Client.Configuration.Settings.GetBoolean("enableLogSubmission", true);
 
    // only cancel event submission if it’s a log event and enableLogSubmission is false
    if (context.Event.Type == Event.KnownTypes.Log && !enableLogSubmission) {
        context.Cancel = true;
    }
});
```

***

## .NET Helpers

The `GetBoolean` method checks the `enableLogSubmission` key. This helper method makes it easy to consume saved client configuration values. The first parameter defines the settings key (name). The second parameter is optional and allows you to set a default value if the key doesn’t exist in the settings or was unable to be converted to the proper type (e.g., a boolean).

We have a few helpers to convert string configuration values to different system types. These methods also contain overloads that allow you to specify default values.

###Helpers###

* `GetString`
* `GetBoolean`
* `GetInt32`
* `GetInt64`
* `GetDouble`
* `GetDateTime`
* `GetDateTimeOffset`
* `GetGuid`
* `GetStringCollection` (breaks a comma delimited list into an IEnumerable of strings)

## Updating Client Configuration settings

All project settings are synced to the client in almost real time. When an event is submitted to Exceptionless we send down a response header with the current configuration version. If a newer version is available we will immediately retrieve and apply the latest configuration. 

By default the client will check after `5 seconds` on client startup (*if no events are submitted on startup*) and then every `2 minutes` after the last event submission for updated configuration settings. 
  * Checking for updated settings doesn't count towards plan limits. 
  * Only the current configuration version is sent when checking for updated settings (no user information will ever be sent). 
  * If the settings haven't changed, then no settings will be retrieved.

You can also **turn off the automatic updating of configuration settings when idle** using the code below.

```csharp
ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.UpdateSettingsWhenIdleInterval = TimeSpan.Zero;
```

You can also manually update the configuration settings using the code below.

```csharp
await Exceptionless.Configuration.SettingsManager.UpdateSettingsAsync(ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration);
```

## Subscribing to Client Configuration Setting changes

To be notified when client configuration settings change, subscribe to them using the below code.

```csharp
ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.Settings.Changed += SettingsOnChanged;

private void SettingsOnChanged(object sender, ChangedEventArgs<KeyValuePair<string, string>> args) {
   Console.WriteLine("The key {0} was {1}", args.Item.Key, args.Action);
}
```
