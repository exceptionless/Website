We have put together an example for the JavaScript client that you can use to get an idea of how everything works. It is [available on the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/tree/master/example). You can clone the repository and run the code as is or you can use the repository example as a starting point.
