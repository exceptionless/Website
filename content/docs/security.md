Exceptionless follows industry best practices and uses SSL out of the box to be as secure as possible. We also provide you with the tools to take your information security to the next level. These tools include Data Exclusions. To accommodate various data protection laws, Exceptionless allows you to prevent the transmission of specified pieces of information through Data Exclusions.

### Data Exclusions

These exclusions are simply a comma delimited list of field names that should be removed from any error report data (e.g., extended data properties, form fields, cookies and query parameters). Data Exclusions can be configured on the project settings page. You can also specify a field name with wildcards `*` to specify starts with, ends with, or contains just to be extra safe.

#### Example usage:

Entering `Password` will remove any field **named** `Password` from the report.
Entering `Password*` will remove any field that **starts with** `Password` from the report.
Entering `*Password` will remove any field that **ends with** `Password` from the report.
Entering `*Password*` will remove any field that **contains** `Password` from the report.
