Our [API](https://api.exceptionless.io) utilizes Swagger and Swashbuckle to automatically generate, update, and display documentation (which means it works without any work on your end when you are self-hosting). It is a great resource for our users that want to get their hands dirty and use Exceptionless data to roll their own tools, dashboards, etc.

To view the full API documentation, visit <https://api.exceptionless.io> and click on the `API Documentation` link to be taken to the API documentation. With Swagger, you will have examples for all endpoints that include required parameters and potential responses.
