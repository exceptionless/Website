Remember, you can refer to the full, self-updating, documentation [here](https://api.exceptionless.io). But let's get started with some real examples to get you authenticated, which will allow access to other endpoints. Exceptionless protects your account by requiring authentication which takes the form of a `Bearer` Authorization header.

## Get Your User Scoped Token

Before you can post project-specific events and make project-specific API requests, you'll need to first generate a user token which can then be used to generate tokens for your projects. 

*NOTE: If you signed up using an OAuth flow with Google or something else, you will need to create a local login to be able to use this endpoint.* 

Let's take a look at an example. 

POST `/api/v2/auth/login`  

```
curl --location --request POST "https://api.exceptionless.com/api/v2/auth/login" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": YOUR_EMAIL,
    "password": PASSWORD
}'
```

Your response should look like this: 

```
{
    "token": "ojcQ1YVtKBnFITzJB3RFkdWRaVGdghHZoHvGKbx4"
}
```

Now that you have your token, you can get your project-specific API key (or token) which will allow you to execute API requests against a specific project. It's worth also noting that you can easily update your requests to authenticate via a URL query string and your access token.

For example, if we want to view our organizations, we simply navigate to <https://api.exceptionless.io/api/v2/organizations>, add the query string `?access_token={token}` rather than a Bearer token authorization header.
