Please follow this section to set up Exceptionless in a Kubernetes environment. Please note this section is a work in progress, any contributions is greatly appreciated.

## Requirements

* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
* [Helm](https://helm.sh)

## Instructions

Please note that we recommend you use Kubernetes for running in production.

1. Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/blob/master/k8s/ex-setup.ps1) for how to create it in AKS
2. View the configuration settings below for more information on configuring Exceptionless.
3. [Configure your clients](../clients/) to send errors to your website.

Now, you can create a local account, organization, and project and send events to it.

## Configuration

The following section will cover how to configure exceptionless inside of a Kubernetes instance using the `exceptionless-config` config map. All exceptionless configuration keys are prefixed with `EX_`. Please note that these instructions also apply to docker using environment variables.

All configuration options and settings can be found in the various option classes located [here](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/tree/master/src/Exceptionless.Core/Configuration).

_Please note that if you are specifying configuration via `docker-compose`, then you will need to drop the `EX_` and `EX_ConnectionStrings__` prefixes._

## ConnectionStrings

```yaml
# connection string used for any provider specifying Redis.
EX_ConnectionStrings__Redis: localhost:6379,abortConnect=false

EX_ConnectionStrings__Cache: provider=redis;
EX_ConnectionStrings__Elasticsearch: server=http://10.0.0.4:9200;
EX_ConnectionStrings__Email: smtps://user%40domain.com:password@smtp.domain.com:465
EX_ConnectionStrings__MessageBus: provider=redis;
EX_ConnectionStrings__Metrics: provider=statsd;server=localhost
EX_ConnectionStrings__Queue: provider=redis;
EX_ConnectionStrings__Storage: provider=azurestorage;
```

You can append values to any connection string using a `;`. For example, you can control many shards and replicas each Elasticsearch index should be created with by appending to the `EX_ConnectionStrings__Elasticsearch` connection string. For a Elasticsearch cluster (3 nodes, two masters), you would append `shards=3;replicas=1`.

The `provider` value determines what implementations to use for the various abstractions. We've made it easier to reuse a single connection string by automatically looking up a connection string by the provider name and adding any key value pairs to the current connection string (as shown above with redis).

## General Configuration

1. You'll want to set the `EX_ApiUrl` key to your external url of the api.
2. You'll want to set the `EX_BaseUrl` key to your external url of the website. If you are not following the clean urls optional section below, please make sure you also add the hashbang (`/#!`) to the base url.
3. `EX_AppMode` should be set to `Production` if you want to send unrestricted emails.
4. Please take a quick look at all the configuration options and settings that can be found in the various option classes located [here](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/tree/master/src/Exceptionless.Core/Configuration).

## Active Directory Authentication

To enable Active Directory authentication, update the Update the `exceptionless-config` config map to include the `EX_ConnectionStrings__LDAP` connection string. The value should be your domain's LDAP URI (e.g. `LDAP://ad.domain.com/` or `LDAP://ad.domain.com/DC=domain,DC=com`).

Please note the following:

1. Users must still go through the registration process using their AD credentials. This allows account setup to proceed as normal. AD credentials are **not** stored.
2. Exceptionless relies on the following properties being available in AD:
    * `mail`: user's email address
    * `givenName`: user's first name
    * `sn`: user's last name
    * `sAMAccountName`: user's username
3. To ensure the correct account information is retrieved for a user, consider using a more specific connection string to narrow down the LDAP account type. For example: `LDAP://ad.domain.com/OU=Standard Users,OU=User Accounts,DC=domain,DC=com`

## Enabling Slack Integrations

1. Create a Slack app for your workspace
    * __Please do not distribute your app outside of your organization.__
2. Go to the `OAuth & Permissions` feature. Add a new redirect URL. The redirect URL should be your Exceptionless base URL.
3. On the *basic info* page of your Slack App, you will need to find the Client ID and Client Secret
4. Update the `exceptionless-config` config map `ConnectionStrings__OAuth` value to include `SlackId=YOUR_ID;SlackSecret=YOUR_SECRET;` and restart the associated pods.
5. If you've already loaded a page in Exceptionless, you will need to do a hard refresh for the config changes to apply.

## Upgrading

Please see the [Upgrading](upgrading-self-hosted-instance.md) for details on how to upgrade to the current version.

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues please try the following to resolve the issues. If this doesn't work please open an issue or contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xv3sjurVwA).

* Make sure you are running the latest release by visiting our [releases page](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/releases). You can verify the version you are currently running by accessing the status page [`http://localhost/api/v2/about`](http://localhost/api/v2/about).
* You can also enable detailed logging by updating the `Serilog__MinimumLevel__Default` config map value to `Debug`.
