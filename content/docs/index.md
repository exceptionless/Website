title: Overview
---
The definition of the word exceptionless is: to be without exception. Exceptionless provides real-time error reporting for your JavaScript, Node, .NET Core, ASP.NET, Web API, WebForms, WPF, Console, and MVC apps. It organizes the gathered information into simple actionable data that will help your app become exceptionless!

Exceptionless focuses on real-time configurability which sets it apart from other error monitoring services. Where others might require a configuration change in your code and a re-deployment of your app, Exceptionless allows you to make changes without ever changing your deployed code.
