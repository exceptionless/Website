We are thrilled to announce the release of our latest version of the [Exceptionless .NET client](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.Net), version 5.0. This release includes a major new feature, support for Blazor.

## Blazor Support

Blazor is a framework for building web applications using C# and Razor, a markup syntax for HTML. It allows developers to build interactive, client-side web applications with .NET. This means that you can now use Exceptionless to track and report errors in your Blazor applications with the same ease and flexibility that you have come to expect from our .NET client.

With this release, Exceptionless now supports both server-side and client-side Blazor. This means that you can track and report errors that occur on the server, as well as in the browser. This is particularly useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues that may only occur in certain browser environments.

Upgrading to the latest version of the Exceptionless .NET client is simple. Just update your [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Exceptionless/), and youâ€™re good to go. As always, our documentation is available to help you with the upgrade process, and our support team is always here to answer any questions you may have.

## We want to hear from you

We are constantly working to improve our .NET client and provide the best error tracking and reporting experience for .NET developers. With the addition of Blazor support, we believe that we have taken another step forward in achieving that goal. We can't wait to see what you build with it!
