## .NET Exceptionless Client v3.2.0 Release Details

### Additions & Improvements

**Read Configuration**
We added support for reading configuration from environmental variables and app settings

**Closing Applications
** Closing applications after submission is now easier due to the new `SubmittedEvent` event handler.

**Custom Persistence Settings
** The new `QueueMaxAttempts` and `QueueMaxAge` configuration settings allow custom persistence settings and are intended to improve offline support. Thanks @airwareic!

**Data Exclusions Improvements**
We've made huge improvements to Data Exclusions, which now check default data and extra exception properties.

**New Overloads
** Thanks @xbelt for creating overloads for `CreateLog` and `SubmitLog` to accept the `LogLevel` enum!

**Custom Themes**
@mgnslndh updated the styling of the `CrashReportDialog` to play nice with custom themes. Thanks!

**Dependencies
** All dependencies (Nancy, NLog, etc) have been updated.

**Deprecated!
** The `EnableSSL` property has been marked Obsolete because it is no longer used. `ServerURL` is now being looked at for this.

### Fixes

**Startup()
** `Startup()` was overriding configured dependencies - Fixed!

**Empty Errors
** We fixed a bug where you could have empty errors submitted with no stack trace info.

**API Keys**

* Previously set valid API keys were being overwritten with default API keys, so we fixed it.
* We also fixed an issue where `ApiKey` couldn't be changed after the client was initialized.

**Reference IDs**
An issue with submitting generated reference IDs was resolved, thanks to @srijken

**Updating WebAPI Package
** @srijken also fixed another issue where updating the WebApi package would remove the Exceptionless Module. Thanks again!

**NLog**
Nlog wasn't working with .NET 4.0. This has been resolved.

**IsolatedStorage**
There was a problem that caused IsolatedStorage to not be able to be used. Fixed!

**Min Log Level**
NLog and log4net have been updated to allow setting the min log level.
