    <h2>The Power of .NET Error Reporting</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-438" style="margin-left: 10px;" alt="ApexCCTV Logo" src="/website/assets/img/news/header-logoNew.png" width="182" height="96" data-id="438"> One of our long time customers, ApexCCTV, recently described how Exceptionless' .NET error reporting allowed them to find and squash a bug that was causing their website to be completely unusable by some customers.</p>
<p>Because of the e-commerce development environment being used, this issue would not have been brought to their attention without the implementation of Exceptionless, making this a prime example of how powerful the tool is and what it can mean for all types of .NET web applications.<!--more--></p>
<h3>What customers were experiencing</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"After a site upgrade, <strong>every page</strong> of the site was crashing if the customer had been previously logged in." - ApexCCTV</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if a user had selected the "keep me logged in" box the last time they logged in, prior to the update, nothing was working for them.</p>
<h3>The cause</h3>
<p>When a customer logs in, a secure cookie for that user is created behind the scenes. The code update had changed the format of the cookie, but not the name, so when a user visited the site with the old cookie, the authentication was breaking. This was throwing errors and crashing the site for the customer, but because the development team clears cookies regularly, and no one had reported any issues, the exceptions were flying under the radar.</p>
<h3>The fix</h3>
<p>Exceptionless logged and reported the error, and the fix was easy - simply change the cookie name so that users were forced to get a fresh cookie the next time they visited the site. Bam, done! Users could then happly log in and buy <a title="Security Cameras" href="http://www.apexcctv.com" target="_blank">security cameras</a> without any issues.</p>
<p>There could be, and a lot of the times are, errors like this in any .NET project, and using a real-time exception reporting tool like Exceptionless can really be an asset, saving time, money, and customers.</p>

    <p>We have all worked on projects, large and small, where tiny, one-off bugs went unnoticed for <em>a while</em>&nbsp;before they were finally reported by a user or discovered by a developer. In some instances, these bugs probably affected the end-user's ability to use the service, purchase an item, etc, meaning that there was a direct impact on the bottom line.</p>
<p>What if you didn't have to worry about .NET exceptions going unnoticed anymore?<!--more--></p>
<h2>Enter real-time .NET exception reporting</h2>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/toexceptionless1-300x150.png" alt="Exceptionless ASP.NET Error Reporting"></p>
<p>What .NET developers needed was a tool that focused on error reporting by logging, grouping, and sending notifications. They needed flexibility through custom objects and a fluent API. They needed every error detail presented in a organized, readable manner. The even needed charts that clearly showed their progress in squashing the tens, hundreds, or thousands of daily exceptions that they didn't know they were occurring.</p>
<p>We needed all that, too, so <strong>we built a tool that does it all for us!</strong></p>
<h3>What a .NET exception reporting tool has up its sleeves</h3>
<p>When we set out to build Exceptionless, we went through hundreds of possible features, and even toyed with building a larger product that including other functionality, but in the end we decided we wanted it to do the following things really well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send error <strong>notifications</strong></li>
<li><strong>Group exceptions</strong> intelligently into stacks</li>
<li><strong>Show top errors</strong>&nbsp;and allow them to be&nbsp;<strong>prioritized</strong></li>
<li>Provide <strong>detailed error reports</strong>, including <strong>stacktrace</strong></li>
<li>Have a&nbsp;<strong>dashboard</strong> with an immediate view of error statistics and trends</li>
<li>Allow <strong>custom objects</strong> to be added to reports</li>
<li>Allow <strong>unlimited users</strong> per organization</li>
<li>Give developers a way to **mark exceptions critical, fixed, or&nbsp;**<strong>monitor for regressions</strong></li>
<li>Provide <strong>real-time updates</strong>, as exceptions happen</li>
<li><strong>Support offline usability</strong> in scenarios where the developer is traveling, etc</li>
<li>Be able to be <strong>installed in less than 5 minutes</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Exceptionless is a must-try for .NET developers</h3>
<p><strong>You should give it a shot if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Finding that bug 2 weeks sooner could have saved you or your company a lot of money</li>
<li>Customers were lost because of a bug on production that you couldn't see locally or in the development environment</li>
<li>You fixed a bug in one spot, only to find out that it was happening in several other places as well</li>
<li>There might be errors here or there, but they probably aren't affecting very many users <em>(hint: they probably are)</em>.</li>
<li>You or your team are making a lot of changes in the next sprint, and you really want to make sure you know when a bug gets introduced</li>
<li><em>and the list goes on...</em></li>
</ul>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2014/2014-01-04-find-leaking-exceptions-eliminate-empty-catch-block/">Find Leaking Exceptions by Eliminating Empty Catch Blocks - Case Study</a></h2>
    <h2>How a client eliminated 50+ exceptions/hour</h2>
<p>Recently, a client contacted us and gave us a pretty incredible case study. He found a huge number of "leaking" exceptions by eliminating all of the empty catch statements in his ASP.NET code and sending an exception to Exceptionless instead. By doing so, he was able to track down about <strong>12 individual bugs</strong> and get rid of <strong>over 50 exceptions per hour</strong> by fixing them. That's <strong>1200+ exceptions per day</strong> - gone!<!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This gave us a picture of just how many poorly written methods were leaking exceptions. The answer was, A LOT. So, even though these weren't customer facing, they were expensive and a good indicator of code quality. In just a couple of days, we were able to eliminate the majority of them completely." - Eric Burcham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After speaking with Mr. Burcham further, he explained that while there were only about 12 individual bugs, the number of times that those bugs were occurring in different areas throughout the code (an ASP.NET eCommerce solution) was numerous. Luckily, he was able to use several multi-line find and replace actions to make all the changes relatively quickly and get things back on track.</p>
<h2>A brief code example</h2>
<h3>Empty .NET catch blocks</h3>
<p>Before using Exceptionless to generated exceptions, the catch blocks were empty.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cs hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>
{
  <span class="hljs-comment">// Do Something</span>
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span> { }
</code></pre>
<h3>Using Exceptionless to generate an exception in the catch block</h3>
<p>By submitting an exception in the catch block, instead, their eyes were opened to thousands of daily exceptions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cs hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>
{
  <span class="hljs-comment">// Do Something</span>
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span>(Exception ex)
{
  ex.ToExceptionless().Submit();
}
</code></pre>
<h3>But I can already throw an exception in my catch block...</h3>
<p>While you can throw an exception in a catch block normally with .NET, Eric was able to utilize Exceptionless' intelligent error grouping, notifications, and detailed reporting to pinpoint the problems and deal with them accordingly. Then, he was able to monitor the decline of occurrences and make sure that there were no regressions. That's pretty powerful, we think.</p>

    <p>We cover the basic features of the Exceptionless platform on our <a href="/website/tour/" title="Exceptionless Feature Tour">feature tour page</a>, but we wanted to give everyone a deeper look into all the information available via the web-based, real-time .NET error reporting admin area.</p>
<p>Continue reading to learn more.<!--more--></p>
<h2>The Dashboard</h2>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/graph.jpg" alt="Visual .NET Exception Graph"></p>
<p>The Exceptionless Dashboard features a quick overview of the exceptions for the currently selected project. It also updates in real-time, so you can watch exceptions roll in.</p>
<p>This is a great place to glimpse your exceptions by total, unique, new, or per hour. The most frequent and most recent exceptions are also displayed here, along with a graph representing your total and unique exceptions. You can go directly to an error's details by clicking on it.</p>
<p><strong>At the top of the page, throughout the admin, you can:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Change the project you are currently viewing</li>
<li>Go to that projects settings</li>
<li>Adjust the date range</li>
<li>Show/Hide hidden errors</li>
<li>Show/Hide fixed errors</li>
<li>Show/Hide "Not Found" errors<figure id="attachment_1340" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 150px"></figure></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/date-range-150x150.jpg" alt="Exceptionless Date Range Selector"></p><figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">Show/Hide Errors &amp; Select Date Range</figcaption><p></p>
<div style="clear: both;">
</div>
<h2>View Most Recent, Most Frequent, and New Exceptions</h2>
<p>On the left side of the dashboard, you can select to view your Most Recent, Most Frequent, or New (first time) .NET exceptions.</p><figure id="attachment_1221" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 150px"><p></p>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/new-150x150.jpg" alt="New .NET Exceptions"></p><figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">New Errors</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<div style="clear: both;">
</div>
<h3>Most Recent</h3>
<p>The most recent report lists your errors individually with the one that occurred last at the top. It also tells you exactly how long ago the error occurred. You can click into the exception to view details.</p>
<h3>Most Frequent and New Exceptions</h3>
<p>Each of these reports lists the respective error type with a summary, the count, when the error first happened, and the last occurrence. Most frequent is ordered by count, and new is ordered by most recent.</p>
<h2>Lets Take a Look at Exception Details</h2>
<h3>Error Stack Page</h3>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/exception-options-150x150.jpg" alt="Error Stack Options"></p>
<div style="clear: both;">
</div>
<p>If you click into any error, Exceptionless will show you the error stack, which includes the number of occurrences, when it first happened, and the latest re-occurrence. You can adjust the date range on this page, like the rest, and you also get a nice graph of that error's occurrences over time. Each individual time the error triggered is listed below the graph, and you can click into each instance separately.</p>
<p><strong>Before we do that, though,</strong>&nbsp;I'd like to point out another major feature of the error stack page..</p>
<p>Above and to the right of the graph are two buttons: "Mark Fixed" and "Options". Mark fixed is exactly what it sounds like, and if you click on the "Options" button it drops down with the following choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide from reports</li>
<li>Promote to external</li>
<li>Add reference link</li>
<li>Disable notifications</li>
<li>Future occurrences are critical</li>
<li>Reset stats</li>
</ul>
<h3>Individual Error Details</h3>
<p>After you click into an individual error instance, you will see the following tabs.</p>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/exception-details-environment-150x150.jpg" alt=".NET Exception Environment Details"></p>
<div style="clear: both;">
</div>
<h4>Error Overview</h4>
<p>This page shows you a quick overview of the error, including the stack trace. It includes the date and time, type, message, platform, URL, and referrer. You can also go to the previous or next occurrence.</p>
<h4>Exception</h4>
<p>This tab displays a few overview details, then gives you a list of loaded modules related to the error.</p>
<h4>Request</h4>
<p>The request view gives you the request details, including date and time, http method, url, referrer, client IP, user agent, browser, browser OS, device, and whether or not it's a known bot. You also get Post Data.</p>
<h4>Environment</h4>
<p>Because you needed&nbsp;<strong>all</strong> the data, the environment tab displays time and date, machine name, ip address, processor count, total, available, and process memory, OS name, OS version, architecture, runtime version, process ID, process name, and command line details. It also has client information, such as install date, version, platform, submission method, application starts, and errors submitted.</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2015/2015-06-17-the-power-of-real-time-project-settings/">The Power of Real-time Project Settings</a></h2>
    <p>Did you know there are customizable server/client configuration values within your Exceptionless Project's settings? Well <strong>now you do</strong> - and knowing is half the battle!</p>
<p>These project level settings are a dictionary of key value pairs (string key, string value). They are defined server-side and automatically pushed to the client when they are updated. Using this feature allows you to control what you send without redeploying your app, which we think is&nbsp;pretty cool!<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>You can use these client configuration settings for a variety of applications, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Controlling <a href="/website/docs/security/" target="_blank">data exclusions</a> for protecting sensitive information</li>
<li>Enabling / Disabling user signups</li>
<li>Turning logging on or off</li>
<li>Enabling analytics</li>
<li>Controlling information collection</li>
<li>And many more! You can send any key value pair to control whatever you like within your app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take a look at a JavaScript and .NET client usage example to&nbsp;get your rolling with this feature.</p>
<h2>Adding a New Client Configuration Value</h2>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/project-settings-page-300x209.png" alt="Exceptionless Client Configuration Settings"></p>
<p>Before we get started with more of an explanation and an example, we need to add a new key and value. To do so, we go to <code>Admin &gt; Projects</code> in our Exceptionless Dashboard, select the project we are working on, then go to the "Settings" tab.</p>
<p>This is where we can add a "New Client Configuration," which simply consists of the key and value. For the example below, we'll add the (fictional) <code>enableLogSubmission</code> key and set it to <code>true</code>.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>When your application first starts up, your project's client configuration settings are read (from storage) and applied.</p>
<p>If a&nbsp;setting value doesn’t exist in storage, it&nbsp;will be retrieved from the server after the next event submission occurs. We do this by inspecting the response headers and comparing a response header that contains the setting version. If the version doesn’t match the saved setting value then we make a request to get the setting and apply it.</p>
<p><em>It’s worth noting that we allow you to define your own default settings and overwrite them with server side settings, which we'll include in our example.</em></p>
<h3>How do I use the client configuration settings?</h3>
<p>In the example below, we will dynamically turn on or off the log event submissions&nbsp;at runtime without restarting the&nbsp;app or logging into the server to change configuration settings.</p>
<p><strong>Why, you ask?</strong> Maybe we don't&nbsp;care about log submission until there is a really tough issue to solve. With Client Configuration Values, we can simply&nbsp;turn it on only when needed.</p>
<p>We’ll assume for this example that we are using the <code>enableLogSubmission</code> key we created above to control this. This setting is made up and doesn’t have to exist server side since&nbsp;we will be providing a default value client side. This allows us to define it via the project settings page at anytime and change our applications behavior.</p>
<p>To control this we will be registering a new <a href="/website/how-to-add-a-plugin-to-affect-events-in-exceptionless/" target="_blank">client side plugin</a> that runs every time an event is created. If our key (<code>enableLogSubmission</code>) is set to false and the event type is set to log,&nbsp;we will discard the event.</p>
<h3>.NET Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-cs hljs language-csharp">ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.AddPlugin(<span class="hljs-string">"Conditionally cancel log submission"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">100</span>, context =&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> enableLogSubmission = context.Client.Configuration.Settings.GetBoolean(<span class="hljs-string">"enableLogSubmission"</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);

    <span class="hljs-comment">// only cancel event submission if it’s a log event and enableLogSubmission is false</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (context.Event.Type == Event.KnownTypes.Log &amp;&amp; !enableLogSubmission) {
        context.Cancel = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>You might notice that we are calling the <code>GetBoolean</code> method to check the <code>enableLogSubmission</code> key. This is a helper method that makes it easy to consume saved client configuration values. The first parameter defines the settings key (name). The second parameter is optional and <strong>allows you to set a default value</strong> if the key doesn’t exist in the settings or was unable to be converted to the proper type (e.g., a boolean).</p>
<h4>.NET Helpers</h4>
<p>Above, we used the <code>GetBoolean</code> helper method. In the .NET client, we have a few helpers to convert string configuration values to different system types. These methods also contain overloads that allow you to specify default values.</p>
<p><strong>Helper List</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>GetString</code></li>
<li><code>GetBoolean</code></li>
<li><code>GetInt32</code></li>
<li><code>GetInt64</code></li>
<li><code>GetDouble</code></li>
<li><code>GetDateTime</code></li>
<li><code>GetDateTimeOffset</code></li>
<li><code>GetGuid</code></li>
<li><code>GetStringCollection</code> (breaks a comma delimited list into an IEnumerable of strings)</li>
</ul>
<h3>JavaScript Example</h3>
<p>The same functionality above can also be achieved using our new <a href="/website/news/2015/2015-06-09-javascript-node-js-client-v1-release-notes">JavaScript Client</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript">exceptionless.<span class="hljs-property">ExceptionlessClient</span>.<span class="hljs-property">default</span>.<span class="hljs-property">config</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">addPlugin</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Conditionally cancel log submission'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">100</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">context, next</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> enableLogSubmission = context.<span class="hljs-property">client</span>.<span class="hljs-property">config</span>.<span class="hljs-property">settings</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'enableLogSubmission'</span>];

    <span class="hljs-comment">// only cancel event submission if it’s a log event and</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// enableLogSubmission is set to a value and the value is not true.</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (context.<span class="hljs-property">event</span>.<span class="hljs-property">type</span> === <span class="hljs-string">'log'</span> &amp;&amp; (!!enableLogSubmission &amp;&amp; enableLogSubmission !== <span class="hljs-string">'true'</span>)) {
       context.<span class="hljs-property">cancelled</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
    }

    <span class="hljs-title function_">next</span>();
});
</code></pre>
<h2>Subscribing to Setting Changes</h2>
<p>If you would like to be notified when client configuration settings are changed, you can subscribe to them using something like the below code. This is useful when you want to update your application in real time when settings change server side.</p>
<h3>.NET</h3>
<pre><code class="language-cs hljs language-csharp">ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.Settings.Changed += SettingsOnChanged;

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">SettingsOnChanged</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-built_in">object</span> sender, ChangedEventArgs&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>&gt;&gt; args</span>)</span> {
   Console.WriteLine(<span class="hljs-string">"The key {0} was {1}"</span>, args.Item.Key, args.Action);
}
</code></pre>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript">exceptionless.<span class="hljs-property">SettingsManager</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">onChanged</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">configuration</span>)  {
   <span class="hljs-comment">// configuration.settings contains the new settings</span>
});
</code></pre>
<h2>Any Questions?</h2>
<p>These Client Configuration Values are somewhat of a hidden Exceptionless gem, but we think they are power and that many of our users can find real value in using them to control the flow of information, specifically sensitive data.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments, please let us know. As usual, we're all ears!</p>

<p>The newest addition to Exceptionless, our JavaScript / Node.js client, needs a place for documentation too! Naturally, that place is within the Exceptionless.JavaScript repo! Here you'll find JavaScript-specific details, examples, and tutorials for things like configuring the client, sending events, self hosting, RequireJS, SystemJS, TypeScript, Express, and client configuration values.</p>
<p>We really hope this helps users familiarize themselves with the JavaScript client and get the most benefit out of it. We know its flexibility will help a ton of developers get their apps in order.</p>
<p><a href="/website/docs/clients/javascript/" target="_blank">View the JavaScript Docs</a></p>
<h2>You Can Contribute, Too!</h2>
<p>Do you know something that could use a better example, description, or tutorial? Have you put together something that would add value for other Exceptionless users if added to the documentation? Shoot any thoughts, examples, feedback, or requests our way and we'll make sure it gets handled properly.</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2015/2015-10-28-exceptionless-3-1-released-if-you-thought-it-was-fast-before/">Exceptionless 3.1 Released! If You Thought It was Fast Before...</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/exceptionles-3-1-header.png" alt="exceptionles-3-1-header">If you thought Exceptionless was fast before, <strong>prepare to have your mind&nbsp;blown</strong> by what we've been able to do in version 3.1, which released today.</p>
<p>In short, we've reduced cpu and memory usage, increase caching efficiency, and sped up searching, all quite significantly as you'll see below.</p>
<p>Along with these speed boosts, we've also made Job improvements (look for a blog post on this soon) and upgraded to .NET 4.6 (<strong>self-hosters</strong>, please install .NET 4.6 on your servers before upgrading).</p>
<p>Details on the release changes can be found below.<!--more--></p>
<h2>It's All About Speed!</h2>
<h3>CPU &amp; Memory</h3>
<p>We reduced the CPU and Memory load <strong>across the entire app</strong>. This allows the application to use fewer&nbsp;resources, meaning it has more time to process additional events, making everything faster. Between making Exceptionless and <a href="https://github.com/FoundatioFx/Foundatio">Foundatio</a> 100% Async and these improvements, we've drastically increased the efficiency of the entire platform.</p>
<p><strong>Below</strong>, we see the increase in performance from two examples.&nbsp;On the left, we see a reduction in CPU and Memory usage for a deployed web app instance. On the right is a visible reduction in CPU usage for an Elasticsearch node.</p>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/cpu-memory-percentage-improvements-e1446046152986-1024x343.png" alt="cpu-memory-percentage-improvements"></p>
<h3>Elasticsearch Queries</h3>
<p>By profiling the Elasticsearch queries for efficiency and usage, we've been able to reduce the overall number we were running and improve the efficiency on the ones that still are.</p>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/search-request-rate-improvements-e1446046076483.png" alt="search-request-rate-improvements"></p>
<h3>Caching</h3>
<p>Caching efficiency has been improved by removing redundant components that were utilizing valuable resources.&nbsp;For example, we removed the SignalR Redis Backplane, which drastically decreased the number of calls to Redis. Overall, we've made the app smarter throughout regarding how we cache and retrieve data.</p>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/cache-improvements-2-e1446046201498-1024x346.png" alt="cache-improvements-2"></p>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/Caching-improvements-e1446046263253-300x224.png" alt="Caching-improvements"></p>
<h3>Long-running API Tasks</h3>
<p>We've offloaded long-running API tasks to background jobs, freeing up a lot of resources in the app and allowing us to scale work items independently. For example, marking a stack as fixed or removing a project may take a few moments to be updated now, but the trade-off is worth it. We're working on updating the UI experience to prompt users that the task is running in the background.</p>
<h2>Other Improvements</h2>
<h3>Jobs</h3>
<p>We've made each Job a console app, so it's much easier to debug and deploy. Look for a full blog post on Job improvements soon.</p>
<h3>.NET 4.6</h3>
<p>Exceptionless is now running on .NET 4.6, which has improved startup time due to various improvements with the new version. <strong>Self-hosting users</strong> should be sure to upgrade to .NET 4.6 on their servers before updating Exceptionless.</p>
<h2>Upgrading</h2>
<p>For full release notes and to download the latest version, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/releases">GitHub Release Page</a>.</p>
<h2>Always Improving</h2>
<p><strong>We're always striving to improve</strong> the efficiency of Exceptionless and all of our projects. If you see any room for improvement or have any comments when using anything from us, please send us an in-app message, submit a GitHub issue or <a href="/website/contact/">contact us</a>&nbsp;on the website.</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2016/2016-05-19-new-client-releases-focus-on-sessions-real-time-configuration-and-logging/">New Client Releases Focus on Sessions, Real Time Configuration, and Logging</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/net-3.5.0-js-1.4.0.png" alt="net-3.5.0-js-1.4.0">Exceptionless.NET v3.5.0 and Exceptionless.JavaScript v1.4.0 have been released and they are chock full of&nbsp;<strong>new features and feature improvements!</strong></p>
<p>There weren't a whole lot of bug fixes with these releases. Could it be that Exceptionless is working and we've squelched&nbsp;most of the bugs? We think so!</p>
<p>Notably, we focused on sessions, real time configuration, and logging, all of which we think you'll find super helpful.</p>
<p>Read on for details.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Exceptionless .NET Client V3.5.0 and JavaScript Client V1.4.0 Release Notes</h2>
<h3>Session Heartbeats No Longer Count Towards Plan Limits!</h3>
<p>We've updated Session Heartbeats and Session End events to be sent through an optimized API end point, and they will no longer count towards your plane's event limits.</p>
<h3>Real Time Project Configuration Improvements</h3>
<p>You can now exclude events by type and source, along with setting minimum log levels, <strong>in real time</strong>. So, for example, if you accidentally disable logging completely, you can <strong>simply update your settings</strong> and the updates will go into affect, restoring functionality!</p>
<p>UI support will be expanded moving forward, but for the time being here is an example project configuration.</p>
<h4>Source</h4>
<p><strong>Key:</strong> <code>@@EVENT_TYPE:SOURCE&lt;br /&gt; </code></p>
<p><strong>Value:</strong> <code>false</code></p>
<p>Any event type or source can be used, and wildcards <code>*</code>&nbsp;are supported, so you can ignore whole event types and set the source to <code>*</code>.</p>
<h4>Disable Submissions of Events with Type Name</h4>
<p><strong>Key:</strong> <code>@@error:*MyCustomException</code></p>
<p>**Value:&nbsp;**<code>false</code></p>
<p>This configuration will disable submission of any error event with a stack trace containing an exception with a type name that ends with <code>MyCustomException</code>. You could also remove the wildcard and specify the full type name with the namespace.</p>
<h4>Log Message Settings</h4>
<p><strong>Key:</strong>&nbsp;<code>@@log:*</code></p>
<p><strong>Value:</strong>&nbsp;<code>off</code></p>
<p>Even though log types are special cased, they still accept rue or false values, so this example completely turns off log messages.</p>
<p>Other known values are <code>Trace</code>, <code>Debug</code>, <code>Info</code>, <code>Warn</code>, <code>Error</code>, <code>Fatal</code>, and <code>Off</code>.</p>
<h4>Minimum Log Level</h4>
<p>**Key:&nbsp;**<code>@@log:MyNamespace.EventPostsJob</code></p>
<p>**Value:&nbsp;**<code>Info</code></p>
<p>This example is setting the minimum log level for <code>EventPostsJob</code>&nbsp;to <code>Info</code>.</p>
<h3>Automatically Check for Updated Configuration Settings on Client Idle</h3>
<p>We've implemented an a<strong>utomatic recurring check for updated configuration settings</strong> that occurs <strong>two minutes</strong> after the last event submission.</p>
<p>A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each configuration check <strong>does not</strong> count towards your account's plan limits.</li>
<li>No user information will be sent - only the current configuration version.</li>
<li>Nothing will be retrieved if no settings have been changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The automatic recurring configuration settings check <strong>can be disable</strong> by calling:</p>
<h4>.NET</h4>
<p><code>client.Configuration.UpdateSettingsWhenIdleInterval = TimeSpan.Zero;</code></p>
<h4>JavaScript</h4>
<p><code>client.config.updateSettingsWhenIdleInterval = -1;</code></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>New Easy Way to Exclude Events from Being Submitted in .NET</h3>
<p>You can now define a simple <code>Func&lt;Event,bool&gt;</code>&nbsp;callback to stop events from being submitted in the .NET client.</p>
<p>For example, if I wanted to ignore any event with a <code>value</code> property of <code>2</code> I could use <code>client.Configuration.AddEventExclusion(e =&gt; e.Value.GetValueOrDefault() != 2);</code></p>
<h3>Bug Fix for SettingsCollection Boolean Values Support in .NET Client</h3>
<p><code>SettingsCollection.GetBoolean(name)</code>&nbsp;was not supporting ``&nbsp;or <code>1</code>&nbsp;as boolean values, but now it does. We are also now supporting <code>yes</code>&nbsp;and <code>no</code>&nbsp;as valid values.</p>
<h3>JavaScript Client Passing Settings Bug</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/csantero">@csantero</a> fixed an issue with passing settings to a new isntance of ExceptionlessClient - thanks!</p>
<h3>Improved Stacking of Angular Response Errors in JavaScript Client</h3>
<p>^^^ Nothing much to say here - the header says it all!</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>We hope these new features and feature improvements help your Exceptionless experience, and we plan to continue to listen to user feedback and improve the system where improvements need to be made. To do that, though, we need to hear what you want out of the app. If you have a favorite feature request, or something that just bothers you, please let us know by dropping us a line on GitHub Issues under the appropriate repository, listed below, or just comment here and we'll figure it out!</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2017/2017-01-24-2017-exceptionless-feature-functionality-and-enhancement-roadmap/">2017 Exceptionless Feature, Functionality, and Enhancement Roadmap</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/elasticsearch-2017-roadmap-header-1024x538.jpg" alt="exceptionless feature roadmap for 2017"></p>
<p>Can you believe it's almost February already! Us either. No rest for the whicked, though, as we sit down to get cranking on our list of Exceptionless changes for 2017.</p>
<p>We have a a great list of features, functionality changes, and enhancements&nbsp;planned, and no doubt we'll work in a few other popular feature requests and, naturally, bug fixes along the way.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the primary roadmap, shall we?<!--more--></p>
<h2>Upgrading to Elasticsearch 5</h2>
<p>Upgrading to Elasticsearch 5 has been in the works for some time now, with early testing starting in late 2016.&nbsp;As of January 23rd, we have <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/issues/145" target="_blank">officially pushed the upgrade to production</a> and are looking for feedback, missed bugs, and performance improvement reports from anyone using it!</p>
<h3>Primary Elasticsearch 5 Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elasticsearch 5 is the latest version of <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products">ElasticSearch</a> and brings in massive improvements to event indexing speed, reduced memory sizes, and much more.</li>
<li>The Elasticsearch libraries support .NET Core, bringing us one step closer to fulfilling a&nbsp;vision that includes cross-platform support.</li>
<li>Our new implementation is built on a new, faster Microsoft Azure and SSD storage infrastructure. This will greatly increase the indexing and searching performance,&nbsp; reducing dashboard latencies, among other things.</li>
<li>With the power of <a href="https://github.com/FoundatioFx/Foundatio.Parsers" target="_blank">Foundatio.Parsers</a> project, we have gained&nbsp;the ability to consume generic aggregations and pivot/report on&nbsp;data any way our users&nbsp;like it.</li>
<li>This upgrade also makes it easier to self host through the use of containers. Our goal is to move the entire app to use containers, which will allow you to self host in seconds!</li>
<li>We will now be doing&nbsp;daily indexes for more performance, fine grained backups, and the ability to more quickly change our indexes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future Exceptionless Notification Changes</h2>
<p>We're always working on notifications, we've got <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/issues/177" target="_blank">several distinct changes we want to work on in 2017</a>. Here are a few of the important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will continue working on&nbsp;rich, rule based notifications for email, services like Slack&nbsp;and HipChat, and more.</li>
<li>Pausing notifications will soon be a thing!</li>
<li>You'll also be able to set up&nbsp;notifications based on the rate of events, so you can know when issues&nbsp;are ramping up or getting out of hand.</li>
<li>Lastly, you will be able to receive a&nbsp;periodic digest email based on activity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Porting to .NET Core and Containers</h2>
<ul>
<li>We want to port the Exceptionless app to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core">.NET Core</a> so we can run it anywhere (macOS, Linux or Windows).</li>
<li>Running on .NET Core also brings massive performance improvements and lower overhead, which will have positive trickle down affects throughout the app.</li>
<li>Once we support .NET Core, we can containerize the entire app, allowing us to scale more easily.</li>
<li>These changes will make self hosting super simple. You'll basically be able to run "docker run -d exceptionless`" and be done!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Custom Exceptionless Dashboards</h2>
<p>We know the dashboard is crucial for many things, and we want to make them&nbsp;more customizable to fit each user's individual cases. At the same time, we want to make sure we maximize business value. So, we plan on working on&nbsp;several <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/issues/229" target="_blank">features and functional aspects of dashboards</a>, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating pre-define dashboards that are more granular, such as device usage, breakdown by exception type, etc.</li>
<li>Allow users to create their own custom dashboards.</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Exceptionless Clients</h2>
<p>We really want to add new native clients to Exceptionless, and are including that as a major goal for 2017. Everything we are working on is moving in that direction, one way or the other, and we hope to make further announcements in this department soon!</p>
<p>We are, of course, always accepting pull requests as well!</p>
<h2>What Are We Missing?</h2>
<p>What have we forgotten? We know everything isn't included on this list, but if we have missed something big that you can't live without, please let us know!</p>
<p>Otherwise, look for a new version announcement&nbsp;<strong>very soon</strong>, and get ready to upgrade and&nbsp;take advantage of several of these new upcoming changes.</p>

    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/new-releases-header3-1024x538.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This past week we released Exceptionless 4.0.2 and Exceptionless.NET 4.0.3, consisting of maintenance updates that fixed several usability issues for self hosters, various performance, issues, bug fixes, and some general improvements.<!--more--></p>
<p>Below is a highlight of the release notes, and don't forget to let us know how we're doing or what can improve by following the relevant links to GitHub and posting an "issue."</p>
<p>Lastly, thanks to all of our contributors for helping us solve problems, add functionality, and improve Exceptionless!</p>
<h2>Exceptionless 4.0.2 Release Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Both <a href="https://github.com/caesay">@caesay</a> and <a href="https://github.com/edwardmeng">@edwardmeng</a>&nbsp;submitted pull requests and helped us solve an issue with sending emails (issue <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/issues/290">#290</a>). <a href="https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit">MailKit</a>, a "cross-platform mail client library,"&nbsp;has now been integrated, adding "fully featured and RFC-compliant SMTP, POP3, and IMAP client implementations" into Exceptionless.
<ul>
<li>There were also a few issues with email when hosting in different environments, such as Azure Functions. In this case, all email settings must be stored in settings and not web.config.&nbsp;So, we moved the MailKit implementation to the insulation project and cleaned up the main mailer class, among a few other tweaks, to further improve email sending in the app. Thanks again caesay and edwardmeng!</li>
<li><strong>If you are self hosting</strong>, please update the email settings in <code>appSettings</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for Azure Storage Queues has been added to the app.</li>
<li>A bug that could cause&nbsp;an exception and make the stack work queue be abandoned when a stack of events was deleted has been fixed.</li>
<li>The GeoIP database was being downloaded each time the app was restarted. That has also been fixed.</li>
<li>Incorrect emails were being generated in some self hosted and dev environments because the BASE_URL didn't contain the proper hashbang (#!). Fixed that issue in this release, as well.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Upgrading to Exceptionless 4.0.2</h3>
<p>You should only worry about upgrading if you are a self hoster. If this is the case, please see the <a href="/website/docs/self-hosting/">Exceptionless self hosting documentation</a>. <strong>Note that changes to the Elasticsearch configuration were made in this release</strong>, so make sure to review the documentation for more information.</p>
<h2>Exceptionless.NET 4.0.3 Release Notes</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>log4net .NET Core support has been added.</li>
<li>404 reporting support in ASP.NET Core has been added.</li>
<li>You can now set the min log level in configuration by calling <code>SetDefaultMinLogLevel</code>, allowing you to set a temporary min log level that is used until the server settings are retrieved.</li>
<li>Client IP support for X-Forwarded-For has been added (thanks <a href="https://github.com/barankaynak">@barankaynak</a>!), which enables us to properly identify individual users and also helps when using proxy servers.</li>
<li>You can now more easily capture the HttpActionContext by adding <code>SetHttpActionContext</code>&nbsp;extension methods to web clients, allowing request and user info to be captured by default when manually submitting events.</li>
<li>We added SetException overload so you can now submit any event type with an exception object. So, for instance, you can now submit a log message through with an exception object and the exception tab will show.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the ASP.NET Core 1.1 runtime was sometimes preventing clients from reporting any data.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where exceptions that converted to 404's were not running the event exclusion logic.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the duplicate checker plugin could DOS itself if you had client logging enabled (disabled by default - only meant for diagnostic logging).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the NLog logger wasn't setting event type.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with package configuration of signed web packages.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where adding our trace listener could blow up due to other invalid configured trace listeners.</li>
<li>Upgraded to the latest version of BenchMarkDotNet and ensure benchmarks run (Contrib <a href="https://github.com/adamsitnik">@adamsitnik</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>Just update your NuGet packages. For more info, check out the <a href="/website/docs/clients/dotnet/upgrading/">upgrade guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Exceptionless.UI 2.6.2 Release Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Previously, long, single-line content could cause the user interface to go crazy while updating event lists. This has been fixed (thanks @caesay!).</li>
<li>Also, tags now wrap to the next line, instead of overflowing the content area. @caesay strikes again!</li>

    <p>Nothing too crazy going on in this week's update. A few tweaks to Exceptionless, Exceptionless.NET, and Exceptionless.JavaScript. Check out the details below, and don't forget to let us know how we're doing!<!--more--></p>
<h2>Weekly Code &amp; Development Update - 4/17/2017</h2>
<h3>Exceptionless Core Updates</h3>
<p>This week we released the Exceptionless 4.0.2 minor release with a few fixes and tweaks. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/releases/tag/v4.0.2">Exceptionless 4.0.2&nbsp;release details</a> over on GitHub. Self hosters are the only ones that will need to worry about upgrading.</p>
<p>We also made some good strides in reducing&nbsp;the amount of IO work the event post queues&nbsp;have to do. Woohoo!</p>
<p>Lastly, for Exceptionless core, we merged in MailKit and continued improving email notifications.</p>
<h2>Exceptionless.NET Client Update</h2>
<p>The only really notable thing we did for the .NET client is fix the&nbsp;ProcessQueue method, making sure it blocks until the queue has been processed.</p>
<h2>Exceptionless.JavaScript Client Update</h2>
<p>For our JavaScript client, we want to work on supporting universal apps, but first we have to upgrade to the latest version of TypeScript, so we did some work this week toward that.</p>

    <p>In this week'd update, Blake does a little traveling and speaking, and both Exceptionless and Foundatio.Repositories get an update!<!--more--></p>
<h2>Blake Speaks @ North Dallas .NET</h2>
<p>On May 3, Blake spoke at the <a href="http://northdallas.net/">North Dallas .NET User Group</a> meetup in Plano. The topic was Exception Driven Development, and of course he killed it! Naturally, the Exceptionless love was shared to all.</p>
<h2>Exceptionless &amp; Foundatio.Repositories Updates</h2>
<p>For Exceptionless, we worked on upgrading the email templates to use Zurb for emails and handlebars. We also fixed an issue where you could only log in 15 times in a 15 minute time period.</p>
<p>For Foundatio.Repositories, <a href="https://github.com/FoundatioFx/Foundatio.Repositories/commit/86c1539a9fdb12880db9a4fba1dccdc27055ccea">query if (FieldEqualsIf) support</a> has been added.</p>
