    <h2>The Power of .NET Error Reporting</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-438" style="margin-left: 10px;" alt="ApexCCTV Logo" src="/website/assets/img/news/header-logoNew.png" width="182" height="96" data-id="438"> One of our long time customers, ApexCCTV, recently described how Exceptionless' .NET error reporting allowed them to find and squash a bug that was causing their website to be completely unusable by some customers.</p>
<p>Because of the e-commerce development environment being used, this issue would not have been brought to their attention without the implementation of Exceptionless, making this a prime example of how powerful the tool is and what it can mean for all types of .NET web applications.<!--more--></p>
<h3>What customers were experiencing</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"After a site upgrade, <strong>every page</strong> of the site was crashing if the customer had been previously logged in." - ApexCCTV</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if a user had selected the "keep me logged in" box the last time they logged in, prior to the update, nothing was working for them.</p>
<h3>The cause</h3>
<p>When a customer logs in, a secure cookie for that user is created behind the scenes. The code update had changed the format of the cookie, but not the name, so when a user visited the site with the old cookie, the authentication was breaking. This was throwing errors and crashing the site for the customer, but because the development team clears cookies regularly, and no one had reported any issues, the exceptions were flying under the radar.</p>
<h3>The fix</h3>
<p>Exceptionless logged and reported the error, and the fix was easy - simply change the cookie name so that users were forced to get a fresh cookie the next time they visited the site. Bam, done! Users could then happly log in and buy <a title="Security Cameras" href="http://www.apexcctv.com" target="_blank">security cameras</a> without any issues.</p>
<p>There could be, and a lot of the times are, errors like this in any .NET project, and using a real-time exception reporting tool like Exceptionless can really be an asset, saving time, money, and customers.</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2014/2014-01-04-find-leaking-exceptions-eliminate-empty-catch-block/">Find Leaking Exceptions by Eliminating Empty Catch Blocks - Case Study</a></h2>
    <h2>How a client eliminated 50+ exceptions/hour</h2>
<p>Recently, a client contacted us and gave us a pretty incredible case study. He found a huge number of "leaking" exceptions by eliminating all of the empty catch statements in his ASP.NET code and sending an exception to Exceptionless instead. By doing so, he was able to track down about <strong>12 individual bugs</strong> and get rid of <strong>over 50 exceptions per hour</strong> by fixing them. That's <strong>1200+ exceptions per day</strong> - gone!<!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This gave us a picture of just how many poorly written methods were leaking exceptions. The answer was, A LOT. So, even though these weren't customer facing, they were expensive and a good indicator of code quality. In just a couple of days, we were able to eliminate the majority of them completely." - Eric Burcham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After speaking with Mr. Burcham further, he explained that while there were only about 12 individual bugs, the number of times that those bugs were occurring in different areas throughout the code (an ASP.NET eCommerce solution) was numerous. Luckily, he was able to use several multi-line find and replace actions to make all the changes relatively quickly and get things back on track.</p>
<h2>A brief code example</h2>
<h3>Empty .NET catch blocks</h3>
<p>Before using Exceptionless to generated exceptions, the catch blocks were empty.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cs hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>
{
  <span class="hljs-comment">// Do Something</span>
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span> { }
</code></pre>
<h3>Using Exceptionless to generate an exception in the catch block</h3>
<p>By submitting an exception in the catch block, instead, their eyes were opened to thousands of daily exceptions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cs hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>
{
  <span class="hljs-comment">// Do Something</span>
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span>(Exception ex)
{
  ex.ToExceptionless().Submit();
}
</code></pre>
<h3>But I can already throw an exception in my catch block...</h3>
<p>While you can throw an exception in a catch block normally with .NET, Eric was able to utilize Exceptionless' intelligent error grouping, notifications, and detailed reporting to pinpoint the problems and deal with them accordingly. Then, he was able to monitor the decline of occurrences and make sure that there were no regressions. That's pretty powerful, we think.</p>
