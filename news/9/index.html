    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/Exceptionless-documentation-github.png" alt="Exceptionless-documentation-github">The <a href="/website/docs/" target="_blank">Exceptionless documentation has moved to GitHub</a>!</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we have taken all the existing documentation on the docs subdomain and migrated it over to the respective GitHub repo.</p>
<p>We also pulled out worthy examples, demos, and tutorials from past blog posts and created pages for those, so information is&nbsp;in a more centralized area that is hopefully easier for our users to locate and utilize.</p>
<p>As new features, demos, examples, and clients come online, expect to see them added to the new documentation system and updated regularly.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Exceptionless Documentation Tour</h2>
<h3>Primary Documentation (hub)</h3>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/github-primary-docs-150x150.png" alt="github-primary-docs"></p>
<p>This documentation contains all the documentation and details/usage for the platform's features and dashboard/ui. That includes information on project settings, security, API usage, filtering &amp; searching, email notifications, bulk actions, frequently asked questions, how to contribute to the project, and the basic requirements to run the platform.</p>
<p>And, of course, you can get to the documentation for the individual clients (below) from this primary site as well.</p>
<p>Basically, you can always start here and branch out to whatever client or feature you're looking for documentation for.</p>
<p><a href="/website/docs/" target="_blank">Check it out!</a></p>
<h3>.NET Client Documentation</h3>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/github-dotnet-150x150.png" alt="github-dotnet"></p>
<p>As you may have guessed, this documentation site resides within the Exceptionless.NET repo and contains .NET-specific info, examples, demos, and tutorials for different features. If you're a .NET user, this should be where you look for examples if you're just getting started or solutions to troubleshooting problems if you've run into a snag.</p>
<p><a href="/website/docs/clients/dotnet/" target="_blank">View the .NET Docs</a></p>
<h3>JavaScript / Node.js Client Documentation</h3>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/github-javascript-150x150.png" alt="github-javascript"></p>
<p>The newest addition to Exceptionless, our JavaScript / Node.js client, needs a place for documentation too! Naturally, that place is within the Exceptionless.JavaScript repo! Here you'll find JavaScript-specific details, examples, and tutorials for things like configuring the client, sending events, self hosting, RequireJS, SystemJS, TypeScript, Express, and client configuration values.</p>
<p>We really hope this helps users familiarize themselves with the JavaScript client and get the most benefit out of it. We know its flexibility will help a ton of developers get their apps in order.</p>
<p><a href="/website/docs/clients/javascript/" target="_blank">View the JavaScript Docs</a></p>
<h2>You Can Contribute, Too!</h2>
<p>Do you know something that could use a better example, description, or tutorial? Have you put together something that would add value for other Exceptionless users if added to the documentation? Shoot any thoughts, examples, feedback, or requests our way and we'll make sure it gets handled properly.</p>

    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/blog-header-image-small-case-study.png" alt="blog-header-image-small-case-study">It's always great to hear back from our users, whether it's a simple "atta boy" or a full page's worth of feedback.</p>
<p>Today we thought it would be nice to share a recent case study from one of our users that lives in the scientific laboratory and processing equipment space. Their company is a leading provider of stirring, mixing, and kneading machines, among other things, that are used by the pharmaceutical, chemical, food, paint, cosmetic, and plastics industries around the world. Neat!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It helps me zero in on what could be the issue, AND have a documented track of what all errors I’ve seen."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--more-->
<h2>The Questions</h2>
<p>When a user hits a certain number of sessions with Exceptionless, we shoot them a quick survey email asking them a few things that might help us improve our product and get a better feel for how our users are utilizing it's features.</p>
<p><strong>In a nutshell, we ask the following:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What's the number one customer-facing bug Exceptionless helped you squash?</li>
<li>Were you surprised at the initial results of using Exceptionless for the first time? How many errors were you seeing?</li>
<li>What is the number one internal bug you were able to track down with Exceptionless?</li>
<li>If you had one feature you'd like us to add to Exceptionless, what would it be?</li>
<li>What other examples or feedback do you have?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Answer Time!</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"I’d say that Exceptionless helps me find all the bugs which I’d have to spend more time on zeroing in on, faster."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The user was gracious enough to provide us with the following answers to the above general questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>"Well, since our application is not yet released to the customer, I’m using Exceptionless to report bugs/crashes which I encounter routinely while testing the UI. It helps me zero in on what could be the issue, AND have a documented track of what all errors I’ve seen."</li>
<li>"Since Exceptionless is being used by me DURING development, it’s not surprising at all! 🙂 Maybe 4-5 bugs per day in sporadic bouts of crashes. Sometimes no bugs for a long time!"</li>
<li>"<strong>More than ONE major bug</strong>, I’d say that Exceptionless helps me find all the bugs which I’d have to spend more time on zeroing in on, faster."</li>
<li>"Support for snapshots (user reviewed), memory dump files is my number ONE feature request."</li>
<li>"Will update you on this once I release to customers. But it’s nice having the <strong>confidence</strong> that Exceptionless will help me squash bugs AS they get reported, instead of having to wait for that brave customer who girdles up his loins and takes up the onerous task of finding out how to report bugs and whom to report them to! Most customers would have just cursed me and gone ahead with workarounds! :)"</li>
</ol>
<h2>How About You? Got Any Feedback?</h2>
<p><strong>Consider this for a second:</strong> If every user provided 10 minutes of feedback on the products they use and love, the owners of those products/programs/tools/experiences would be able to improve them much faster and with drastically more focus and drive.</p>
<p>With that said... give us 5, 10, or maybe 15 minutes and answer the above questions for us in the comments below. We're no Microsoft - your voice&nbsp;<strong>will be heard</strong>, and any suggestions will be strongly considered/debated. Who knows - maybe we work on your feature request next!</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2015/2015-06-22-exclude-and-protect-sensitive-data-within-exceptionless/">Exclude and Protect Sensitive Data within Exceptionless</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/data-exclusions.png" alt="Exceptionless Data Exclusions for Security">We realize you may have sensitive data that could potentially be transmitted within an Exceptionless error, event, log message, etc.</p>
<p>In order to help make sure that information is not compromised, we have included a <a href="/website/docs/security">simple comma delimited field for data exclusions</a> on the Exceptionless Project Settings page where you can add field names that you would like to be excluded from any error or event that is reported.</p>
<p>Once set, the excluded field data is discarded at the client level and never hits our servers.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Types of Data You Can Exclude</h2>
<p>You can exclude data from any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended Data Properties</li>
<li>Form Fields</li>
<li>Cookies</li>
<li>Query Parameters</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Exclusion Wildcards</h2>
<p>To be extra careful with your data, using * allows you to specify wildcards that can be used to dictate "starts with," "ends with," or "contains."</p>
<ul>
<li><code>string*</code>
Following the string with a wildcard removes any field that starts with the string from the event report.</li>
<li><code>*string</code>
If you prefix the field name with a wildcard, it will remove any field that ends with the string.</li>
<li><code>*string*</code>
Using a wildcard before and after the string means that the system will remove any field that contains the string.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/data-exclusion-examples.png" alt="Exceptionless Security"></p>
<p>One potential example is, let’s say, user addresses. Perhaps you have multiple user addresses that may get transmitted, and you want to exclude some or all of them. Maybe you have "HomeAddress" and "WorkAddress".</p>
<p>To exclude only "HomeAddress" data, you would just add <code>HomeAddress</code> as an exclusion. The same goes for "WorkAddress."</p>
<p>To exclude both, you could either add <code>HomeAddress</code> and <code>WorkAddress</code>, separated by a comma, or you could use <code>*Address</code> if those were the only two fields that ended with "Address." If those were the only fields that contained "Address" at all, you could use <code>*Address*</code>.</p>
<p>It's easy stuff, but powerful enough to be aware of and use where possible to ensure security.</p>
<h2>What Do You Exclude?</h2>
<p>We are sure you can come up with some creative exclusions for various types of sensitive data. At Exceptionless, we exclude any and all relatively sensitive data to protect our users as much as possible.</p>
<p>Obviously, things like passwords, credit card info, etc are encrypted, but other fields such as addresses, etc, are also relatively sensitive information that typically doesn’t need to be displayed.</p>
<p>What do you exclude? Do you have any feedback about this Exceptionless feature? Let us know!</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2015/2015-06-17-the-power-of-real-time-project-settings/">The Power of Real-time Project Settings</a></h2>
    <p>Did you know there are customizable server/client configuration values within your Exceptionless Project's settings? Well <strong>now you do</strong> - and knowing is half the battle!</p>
<p>These project level settings are a dictionary of key value pairs (string key, string value). They are defined server-side and automatically pushed to the client when they are updated. Using this feature allows you to control what you send without redeploying your app, which we think is&nbsp;pretty cool!<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>You can use these client configuration settings for a variety of applications, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Controlling <a href="/website/docs/security/" target="_blank">data exclusions</a> for protecting sensitive information</li>
<li>Enabling / Disabling user signups</li>
<li>Turning logging on or off</li>
<li>Enabling analytics</li>
<li>Controlling information collection</li>
<li>And many more! You can send any key value pair to control whatever you like within your app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take a look at a JavaScript and .NET client usage example to&nbsp;get your rolling with this feature.</p>
<h2>Adding a New Client Configuration Value</h2>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/project-settings-page-300x209.png" alt="Exceptionless Client Configuration Settings"></p>
<p>Before we get started with more of an explanation and an example, we need to add a new key and value. To do so, we go to <code>Admin &gt; Projects</code> in our Exceptionless Dashboard, select the project we are working on, then go to the "Settings" tab.</p>
<p>This is where we can add a "New Client Configuration," which simply consists of the key and value. For the example below, we'll add the (fictional) <code>enableLogSubmission</code> key and set it to <code>true</code>.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>When your application first starts up, your project's client configuration settings are read (from storage) and applied.</p>
<p>If a&nbsp;setting value doesn’t exist in storage, it&nbsp;will be retrieved from the server after the next event submission occurs. We do this by inspecting the response headers and comparing a response header that contains the setting version. If the version doesn’t match the saved setting value then we make a request to get the setting and apply it.</p>
<p><em>It’s worth noting that we allow you to define your own default settings and overwrite them with server side settings, which we'll include in our example.</em></p>
<h3>How do I use the client configuration settings?</h3>
<p>In the example below, we will dynamically turn on or off the log event submissions&nbsp;at runtime without restarting the&nbsp;app or logging into the server to change configuration settings.</p>
<p><strong>Why, you ask?</strong> Maybe we don't&nbsp;care about log submission until there is a really tough issue to solve. With Client Configuration Values, we can simply&nbsp;turn it on only when needed.</p>
<p>We’ll assume for this example that we are using the <code>enableLogSubmission</code> key we created above to control this. This setting is made up and doesn’t have to exist server side since&nbsp;we will be providing a default value client side. This allows us to define it via the project settings page at anytime and change our applications behavior.</p>
<p>To control this we will be registering a new <a href="/website/how-to-add-a-plugin-to-affect-events-in-exceptionless/" target="_blank">client side plugin</a> that runs every time an event is created. If our key (<code>enableLogSubmission</code>) is set to false and the event type is set to log,&nbsp;we will discard the event.</p>
<h3>.NET Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-cs hljs language-csharp">ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.AddPlugin(<span class="hljs-string">"Conditionally cancel log submission"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">100</span>, context =&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> enableLogSubmission = context.Client.Configuration.Settings.GetBoolean(<span class="hljs-string">"enableLogSubmission"</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);

    <span class="hljs-comment">// only cancel event submission if it’s a log event and enableLogSubmission is false</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (context.Event.Type == Event.KnownTypes.Log &amp;&amp; !enableLogSubmission) {
        context.Cancel = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>You might notice that we are calling the <code>GetBoolean</code> method to check the <code>enableLogSubmission</code> key. This is a helper method that makes it easy to consume saved client configuration values. The first parameter defines the settings key (name). The second parameter is optional and <strong>allows you to set a default value</strong> if the key doesn’t exist in the settings or was unable to be converted to the proper type (e.g., a boolean).</p>
<h4>.NET Helpers</h4>
<p>Above, we used the <code>GetBoolean</code> helper method. In the .NET client, we have a few helpers to convert string configuration values to different system types. These methods also contain overloads that allow you to specify default values.</p>
<p><strong>Helper List</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>GetString</code></li>
<li><code>GetBoolean</code></li>
<li><code>GetInt32</code></li>
<li><code>GetInt64</code></li>
<li><code>GetDouble</code></li>
<li><code>GetDateTime</code></li>
<li><code>GetDateTimeOffset</code></li>
<li><code>GetGuid</code></li>
<li><code>GetStringCollection</code> (breaks a comma delimited list into an IEnumerable of strings)</li>
</ul>
<h3>JavaScript Example</h3>
<p>The same functionality above can also be achieved using our new <a href="/website/news/2015/2015-06-09-javascript-node-js-client-v1-release-notes">JavaScript Client</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript">exceptionless.<span class="hljs-property">ExceptionlessClient</span>.<span class="hljs-property">default</span>.<span class="hljs-property">config</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">addPlugin</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Conditionally cancel log submission'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">100</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">context, next</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> enableLogSubmission = context.<span class="hljs-property">client</span>.<span class="hljs-property">config</span>.<span class="hljs-property">settings</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'enableLogSubmission'</span>];

    <span class="hljs-comment">// only cancel event submission if it’s a log event and</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// enableLogSubmission is set to a value and the value is not true.</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (context.<span class="hljs-property">event</span>.<span class="hljs-property">type</span> === <span class="hljs-string">'log'</span> &amp;&amp; (!!enableLogSubmission &amp;&amp; enableLogSubmission !== <span class="hljs-string">'true'</span>)) {
       context.<span class="hljs-property">cancelled</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
    }

    <span class="hljs-title function_">next</span>();
});
</code></pre>
<h2>Subscribing to Setting Changes</h2>
<p>If you would like to be notified when client configuration settings are changed, you can subscribe to them using something like the below code. This is useful when you want to update your application in real time when settings change server side.</p>
<h3>.NET</h3>
<pre><code class="language-cs hljs language-csharp">ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.Settings.Changed += SettingsOnChanged;

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">SettingsOnChanged</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-built_in">object</span> sender, ChangedEventArgs&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>&gt;&gt; args</span>)</span> {
   Console.WriteLine(<span class="hljs-string">"The key {0} was {1}"</span>, args.Item.Key, args.Action);
}
</code></pre>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript">exceptionless.<span class="hljs-property">SettingsManager</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">onChanged</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">configuration</span>)  {
   <span class="hljs-comment">// configuration.settings contains the new settings</span>
});
</code></pre>
<h2>Any Questions?</h2>
<p>These Client Configuration Values are somewhat of a hidden Exceptionless gem, but we think they are power and that many of our users can find real value in using them to control the flow of information, specifically sensitive data.</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2015/2015-06-04-javascript-node-js-client-version-1-release-candidate/">JavaScript &amp; Node.js Client Version 1 Release Candidate</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/javascript-release-candidate.jpg" alt="Exceptionless JavaScript Client"></p>
<p>If you've been following along the last few weeks, you know we've been working hard to get the new <a href="/website/javascript-client-available-for-preview-testing/" target="_blank">JavaScript Client</a> up to speed and ready for a version 1 release.</p>
<p><strong>We think we're there!</strong></p>
<p>Whether you're a <a href="/website/javascript-client-demo-exceptionless/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> or <a href="/website/exceptionless-node-js-javascript-client-demo/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> user, you'll be able to enjoy the same full featured exception and event reporting platform that our primary .NET client offers, with fewer platform specific boundaries.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Sure It's Ready?</h2>
<p>We have been doing extensive testing over the course of the last month, which has allowed us to identify issues and inefficiencies throughout. Each of those has been addressed with several improvements and fixes, leaving us with a much faster, more stable client.</p>
<p>Many of the tweaks we made were related to IE9 and Node. Those issues have been resolved and things are working well now. In addition, we further increased performance by shrinking the library size fairly drastically.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we will just be working on bug fixes related to user-reported issues as usage picks up.</p>
<h3>Recent Bug Fixes, Issue Resolutions, &amp; Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensured compatibility with module formats like <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts" target="_blank">es6</a> (<a href="https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs" target="_blank">SystemJS</a>/<a href="http://jspm.io/" target="_blank">jspm</a>) and <a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a></li>
<li>Various IE9 and Node compatibility issues fixed</li>
<li>Decreased library size to improve performance and efficiency</li>
<li>Various other performance&nbsp;improvements</li>
<li>Fixed Angular integration failures with Angular Router</li>
<li>Fixed - Unable to integrate with Aurelia due to node being improperly detected</li>
<li>Changed the implementation of the InMemoryStorage to do a get instead of a get and delete</li>
<li>Unable to post events with the NodeSubmissionClient over http fixed</li>
<li>Fixed - Unit tests are failing due to transpilation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Start Using It!</h2>
<p>We've already released a few blog posts (linked&nbsp;below) that detail how to get up and running, but please visit the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript" target="_blank">Exceptionless.JavaScript GitHub Repo</a> for the most up-to-date documentation.</p>

<h2>How the JavaScript Client was Built</h2>
<p>We built our JavaScript client&nbsp;in <a title="TypeScript" href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript" target="_blank">typescript 1.5</a>&nbsp;transpiled it to es5. Our&nbsp;single client works with both <a title="Exceptionless.JavaScript Node.js Demo" href="/website/news/2015/2015-05-20-exceptionless-node-js-javascript-client-demo" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and JavaScript due to dependency injection and a <a title="Universal Module Definition (UMD)" href="https://github.com/umdjs/umd" target="_blank">Universal Module Definition (UMD)</a>.</p>
<h2>Installing the Exceptionless JavaScript Client</h2>
<h3>Via Bower</h3>
<ol>
<li>Install the package by running <code>bower install exceptionless</code></li>
<li>Add the Exceptionless&nbsp;script to your HTML page. We recommend placing the script at the top of the document to ensure Exceptionless picks up and reports the absolute most potential exceptions and events.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-html hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"bower_components/exceptionless/dist/exceptionless.min.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2>Configuring the Client</h2>
<p>Configuration of the Exceptionless JavaScript client can be accomplished a variety of ways. We list the common ways below, but make sure to check the&nbsp;<a title="Exceptionless JavaScript Client GitHub Page" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript" target="_blank">Exceptionless.JavaScript GitHub repo</a>&nbsp;for the most up to date documentation if you run into any problems using this example code.
<em>NOTE: The only required setting you need to configure is the client's apiKey.</em></p>
<h3>Configuration Options</h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Configure the&nbsp;<code>apiKey</code>&nbsp;as part of the script tag. This method&nbsp;will be applied to all new instances of the ExceptionlessClient</p>
<pre><code class="language-html hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"bower_components/exceptionless/dist/exceptionless.min.js?apiKey=API_KEY_HERE"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Set the&nbsp;<code>apiKey</code>&nbsp;on the default ExceptionlessClient instance.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> client = exceptionless.<span class="hljs-property">ExceptionlessClient</span>.<span class="hljs-property">default</span>;
client.<span class="hljs-property">config</span>.<span class="hljs-property">apiKey</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'API_KEY_HERE'</span>;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Create a new instance of the ExceptionlessClient and specify the&nbsp;<code>apiKey</code> or <a title="Exceptionless.JavaScript Configuration Object" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/blob/v1.6.4/src/configuration/IConfigurationSettings.ts" target="_blank">configuration object</a>. <em>Note that the&nbsp;configuration object is optional.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> client = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> exceptionless.<span class="hljs-title class_">ExceptionlessClient</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'API_KEY_HERE'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// Required</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// or with a configuration object</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//var client = new exceptionless.ExceptionlessClient({</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">//apiKey: 'API_KEY_HERE',</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">//submissionBatchSize: 100</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//});</span>
</code></pre>
<h2>Sending Events</h2>
<p>Unhandled exceptions will automatically be sent to your Exceptionless dashboard once the JavaScript client is configured properly. In order to send additional events, including log messages, feature usages, and more, you can use the code samples below and check the&nbsp;<a title="Exceptionless.JavaScript GitHub Repo" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript" target="_blank">Exceptionless.JavaScript GitHub Repo</a> for the latest examples and documentation.</p>
<h3>Sending Log Messages, Feature Usages, etc</h3>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> client = exceptionless.<span class="hljs-property">ExceptionlessClient</span>.<span class="hljs-property">default</span>;

client.<span class="hljs-title function_">submitLog</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Logging made easy'</span>);

<span class="hljs-comment">// You can also specify the log source and log level.</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// We recommend specifying one of the following log levels: Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error</span>
client.<span class="hljs-title function_">submitLog</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'app.logger'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'This is so easy'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Info'</span>);
client.<span class="hljs-title function_">createLog</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'app.logger'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'This is so easy'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Info'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">addTags</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Exceptionless'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">submit</span>();

<span class="hljs-comment">// Submit feature usages</span>
client.<span class="hljs-title function_">submitFeatureUsage</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'MyFeature'</span>);
client.<span class="hljs-title function_">createFeatureUsage</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'MyFeature'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">addTags</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Exceptionless'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">submit</span>();

<span class="hljs-comment">// Submit a 404</span>
client.<span class="hljs-title function_">submitNotFound</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/somepage'</span>);
client.<span class="hljs-title function_">createNotFound</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/somepage'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">addTags</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Exceptionless'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">submit</span>();

<span class="hljs-comment">// Submit a custom event type</span>
client.<span class="hljs-title function_">submitEvent</span>({ message = <span class="hljs-string">'Low Fuel'</span>, type = <span class="hljs-string">'racecar'</span>, source = <span class="hljs-string">'Fuel System'</span> });
</code></pre>
<h3>Manually Sending Errors</h3>
<p>To manually send events other than the automatically reported unhandled exceptions, you can use our fluent <a title="Exceptionless.JavaScript Event Builder API" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/blob/v1.6.4/src/EventBuilder.ts" target="_blank">event builder API</a>.</p>
<p>The below example demonstrates sending a new error, "test," and setting the ReferenceID, Order and Quote properties, Tags, Geo, UserIdentity, and marking it as Critical.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> client = exceptionless.<span class="hljs-property">ExceptionlessClient</span>.<span class="hljs-property">default</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Error</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'test'</span>);
} <span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span> (error) {
  client.<span class="hljs-title function_">createException</span>(error)
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Set the reference id of the event so we can search for it later (reference:id).</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// This will automatically be populated if you call client.config.useReferenceIds();</span>
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">setReferenceId</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'random guid'</span>)
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Add the order object (the ability to exclude specific fields will be coming in a future version).</span>
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">setProperty</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Order"</span>, order)
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Set the quote number.</span>
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">setProperty</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Quote"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">123</span>)
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Add an order tag.</span>

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Mark critical.</span>
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">markAsCritical</span>()
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Set the coordinates of the end user.</span>
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">setGeo</span>(<span class="hljs-number">43.595089</span>, -<span class="hljs-number">88.444602</span>)
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Set the user id that is in our system and provide a friendly name.</span>
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">setUserIdentity</span>(user.<span class="hljs-property">Id</span>, user.<span class="hljs-property">FullName</span>)
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Submit the event.</span>
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">submit</span>();
}
</code></pre>
<h2>What Data is Collected?</h2>
<p>We built the JavaScript client to be full featured and allow you to report and log all the data our other clients do. It has a fluent API, as mentioned above, and&nbsp;is ready to rock and roll.</p>
<p>We wire up to the window.onerror handler&nbsp;by default, in order to&nbsp;send unhandled exceptions to your Exceptionless dashboard automatically.</p>
<p>Finishing off the Exceptionless JavaScript client features, every event also includes request information.</p>
<p>A few screenshots of an individual event can be found below.</p><figure id="attachment_13248" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 150px"><p></p>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/javascript-client-event-request-info-150x150.png" alt="Exceptionless JavaScript Event Request Details"></p><figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">Request Details</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<h2 style="clear: both;">
  Sample
</h2>
<p>We have put together an <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/tree/master/example" target="_blank">example</a> that you can use to get an idea of how everything works. It is available on the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/tree/master/example" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a>.</p>
<h3>To Get the Example Running...</h3>
<ol>
<li>Clone or download the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/tree/master/example" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a></li>
<li>Edit the HTML file in the root example folder and replace the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/blob/master/example/index.html#L8" target="_blank">existing&nbsp;API Key</a> with yours. Also, comment out the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/blob/master/example/index.html#L16" target="_blank">serverUrl</a>.</li>
<li>Open the HTML file in your browser</li>
<li>Open the console so that you can see the debug messages that the example generates</li>
<li>Click the buttons on the page to submit an event</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="clear: both;">
  Troubleshooting
</h2>
<p>Calling <code>client.config.useDebugLogger();</code>&nbsp;to enable debug logging is recommend and will output messages to the console regarding what the client is doing. Please <a title="Exceptionless JavaScript Client Issues" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/issues" target="_blank">contact us by creating an issue on GitHub</a> if you need help&nbsp;or have any feedback regarding the JavaScript client.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>As we move forward towards version 1.0 of our JavaScript client, we are looking for any and all feedback, so please don't hesitate to <a title="Exceptionless JavaScript Client Feedback" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/issues" target="_blank">let us know what you think, report a bug, etc</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> client = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'exceptionless.node'</span>).<span class="hljs-property">ExceptionlessClient</span>.<span class="hljs-property">default</span>;
</code></pre>
<h2>Configuring the Client</h2>
<p>You can configure the Exceptionless client a few different ways for Node.js. The below is the most common way, but for more configuration options and documentation, visit the <a title="Exceptionless JavaScript Client GitHub Page" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript" target="_blank">Exceptionless.JavaScript GitHub repo</a>. <em>NOTE: The only required setting you need to configure is the client's apiKey.</em></p>
<p>Set the <code>apiKey</code> on the default ExceptionlessClient instance.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> client = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'exceptionless.node'</span>).<span class="hljs-property">ExceptionlessClient</span>.<span class="hljs-property">default</span>;
client.<span class="hljs-property">config</span>.<span class="hljs-property">apiKey</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'API_KEY_HERE'</span>;
</code></pre>
<h2>Sending Events</h2>
<p>Once configured, the Exceptionless Node.js JavaScript client will automatically send your dashboard any unhandled exceptions that happen in your application. If you would like to send additional event types, such as log messages, feature usages, etc, take a look at the below examples.</p>
<p>Make sure to check out the <a title="Exceptionless.JavaScript GitHub Repo" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript" target="_blank">Exceptionless.JavaScript GitHub Repo</a> for the latest examples and documentation.</p>
<h3>Sending Log Messages, Feature Usages, etc</h3>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> client = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'exceptionless.node'</span>).<span class="hljs-property">ExceptionlessClient</span>.<span class="hljs-property">default</span>;

client.<span class="hljs-title function_">submitLog</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Logging made easy'</span>);

<span class="hljs-comment">// You can also specify the log source and log level.</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// We recommend specifying one of the following log levels: Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error</span>
client.<span class="hljs-title function_">submitLog</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'app.logger'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'This is so easy'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Info'</span>);
client.<span class="hljs-title function_">createLog</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'app.logger'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'This is so easy'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Info'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">addTags</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Exceptionless'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">submit</span>();

</code></pre>
<h3>Manually Sending Errors</h3>
<p>In addition to automatically sending all unhandled exceptions, you can also&nbsp;manually send events&nbsp;to Exceptionless using our fluent <a title="Exceptionless.JavaScript Event Builder API" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/blob/v1.6.4/src/EventBuilder.ts" target="_blank">event builder API</a>.</p>
<p>The below example demonstrates sending a new error, "test," and setting the ReferenceID, Order and Quote properties, Tags, Geo, UserIdentity, and marking it as Critical.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> client = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'exceptionless.node'</span>).<span class="hljs-property">ExceptionlessClient</span>.<span class="hljs-property">default</span>;

  <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Error</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'test'</span>);
} <span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span> (error) {
  client.<span class="hljs-title function_">createException</span>(error)
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Set the reference id of the event so we can search for it later (reference:id).</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// This will automatically be populated if you call client.config.useReferenceIds();</span>

}
</code></pre>
<h2>Express.js Support</h2>
<p>If you are using <a title="Express.JS" href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express.js</a> to develop a web application, you can add Exceptionless and start collecting unhandled errors and 404s very quickly. To start, just add the following middleware to the bottom of your middleware definitions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// This middleware processes any unhandled errors that may occur in your middleware.</span>
app.<span class="hljs-title function_">use</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">err, req, res, next</span>) {
 client.<span class="hljs-title function_">createUnhandledException</span>(err, <span class="hljs-string">'express'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">addRequestInfo</span>(req).<span class="hljs-title function_">submit</span>();
 res.<span class="hljs-title function_">status</span>(<span class="hljs-number">500</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">send</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Something broke!'</span>);
});

<span class="hljs-comment">// This middleware processes 404’s.</span>
app.<span class="hljs-title function_">use</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">req, res, next</span>) {
 client.<span class="hljs-title function_">createNotFound</span>(req.<span class="hljs-property">originalUrl</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">addRequestInfo</span>(req).<span class="hljs-title function_">submit</span>();
 res.<span class="hljs-title function_">status</span>(<span class="hljs-number">404</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">send</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Sorry cant find that!'</span>);
});
</code></pre>
<h2>What Data is Collected?</h2>
<p>The JavaScript/Node.js client is full featured, will collect all the information our other clients collect, and has a fluent API&nbsp;as shown above.</p>
<p>By default, we wire up to the processes'&nbsp;<a title="Exceptionless Uncaught Exception Handler" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/blob/v1.6.4/src/exceptionless.node.ts#L29-L31" target="_blank">uncaught exception handler</a>&nbsp;to automatically send any unhandled exceptions to your Exceptionless dashboard. We also submit a log message if your app doesn't&nbsp;shut down properly via inspecting the <a title="Exit Code" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/blob/v1.6.4/src/exceptionless.node.ts#L33-L81" target="_blank">exit code</a>, which&nbsp;is very&nbsp;useful and lets you know what your app is doing. Additionally, any queued up events are processed and sent before your app closes.</p>
<p>Each event contains environment and request information, as well, rounding out the complete list of Exceptionless features that we have made available via the JavaScript client, making it a great&nbsp;error and event reporting/logging solution for all your Node.js projects.</p><figure id="attachment_13200" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 150px"><p></p>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/node-js-event-environment-details-150x150.png" alt="Exceptionless Node.js Event Environment Details"></p><figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">Environment Details</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<h2 style="clear: both;">
  Sample Express.js App
</h2>
<p>We have built a quick<a title="Exceptionless Express.js Sample App" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/blob/master/example/express/app.js" target="_blank">&nbsp;Express.js sample app</a>&nbsp;that you can play around with to get an idea of how the Node.js JavaScript client works with Exceptionless.</p>
<p><strong>Run the sample app by following the steps below:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a></li>
<li><a title="Exceptionless JavaScript Client GitHub" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript" target="_blank">Clone or download our repository from GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate to the example\express folder via the command line (e.g., cd example\express)</li>
<li>Run npm install</li>
<li>Open app.js in your favorite text editor and set the <a title="Exceptionless.JavaScript Sample App apiKey and serverUrl" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/blob/master/example/express/app.js#L5-L6" target="_blank">apiKey</a>..</li>
<li>Run node app.js.</li>
<li>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser to view the express app.</li>
<li>To create an error, navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000/boom">http://localhost:3000/boom</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>We recommend enabling debug logging by calling <code>client.config.useDebugLogger();</code>. This will output messages to the console regarding what the client is doing. Please <a title="Exceptionless JavaScript Client Issues" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/issues" target="_blank">contact us by creating an issue on GitHub</a> if you need assistance or have any feedback for the project.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>As we move forward towards version 1.0 of our JavaScript client, we are looking for any and all feedback, so please don't hesitate to <a title="Exceptionless JavaScript Client Feedback" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/issues" target="_blank">let us know what you think, report a bug, etc</a>.</p>
