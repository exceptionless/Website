    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/tag-filter2-resized.gif" alt="ElasticSearch Exceptionless Filter Demo">If you've used Exceptionless, chances are a <strong>search or filter system</strong> would have helped you out more than once. We know, and we agree! That's why we've made it a priority with Exceptionless 2.0, which is coming very soon.</p>
<p>To expand on our previous "<a href="/website/exceptionless-2-0-user-interface-first-look/" title="Exceptionless 2.0 User Interface FIRST LOOK">Exceptionless 2.0 User Interface FIRST LOOK</a>" article, we want to give everyone a little bit more of a look at the filtering system. This demo isn't anything super fancy, but it gives you a good idea of how easy and fast it will be to filter and search through your event data.</p>
<p>As always, we are looking for feedback on the platform as we continue to draw nearer to launch, so feel free to leave us a comment or contact us and let us know what you think. We hope you like it!<!--more--></p>
<p>https://youtu.be/jIyAYeqHKAM</p>
<h2>Filter Demo Transcript</h2>
<p>Hi there. Today we want to quickly demonstrate the use of the new filtering system in Exceptionless 2.0.</p>
<p>Let's check out a quick example.</p>
<p>With our new tagging system, you can add any tag you like to an exception - so maybe you want to tag various exceptions to be related to a specific feature or issue - you can do that now.</p>
<p>As you can see in our dummy data here, we've introduced Tag 1 through Tag 5 on various exceptions.</p>
<p>If we go back out to the main dashboard and click up here on our filter/search icon, we can give it a quick test.</p>
<p>Lets say I want to see all exceptions tagged "tag4". OK Great. How about tag5? And tag 3? Cool.</p>
<p>Now, we can also do that within a group of exceptions... Let's look at this one. Again, all we do is filter by the different tags to see their frequency, look at individual instances, and more. Let me run through the different tags real quick.</p>
<p>And that's a quick look at the Exceptionless 2.0 Filtering system, which gives you even more control over sorting and finding the information you need.</p>
<h2>Looking forward to filtering your Exceptionless events?</h2>
<p>Great! That's what we like to hear. We think it's going to be super easy, super fast, and even fun for some of you data junkies. Again, if you have any questions or comments, please let us know.</p>

    <p>We can prove it! Exceptionless 2.0 is real, and we've got evidence!</p>
<p>We've been wanting to give everyone a sneak peak for a long time, and today we are excited to finally be able to. Watch the video above to see a high level overview of the new UI and features.</p>
<p>There are still quite a few small things to take care of before we release it, but we are happy to say that we are around the 85% mark as far as being finished. Once we get closer, we will be putting up a live demo/preview site for everyone to play with and give feedback on.</p>
<p>Please don't hesitate to give us any feedback you may have after watching the video or reading the transcript below. We want to hear it!</p>
<!--more-->
<h2><strong>Video Transcript</strong></h2>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/v2VideoThumbnail-300x179.png" alt="Exceptionless 2.0"> Lets take a quick look around, shall we?</p>
<p>Everything is built on angularJS and talking to the REST api, so the UI itself is static, with no more server-rendered views.</p>
<p>There are a few upfront differences - mainly the fact that we're using all the screen real estate now and everything is mobile responsive</p>
<h3>Navigation &amp; Exception Types</h3>
<p>On the left navigation bar, we have the 4 default event types, exceptions, log messages, broken links, and feature usages. Each has a dashboard, most recent, most frequent, and new view, which generates a page very similar to what you're used to seeing.</p>
<p>As promised with version 2.0, we also have an all events section, which you can send literally any event to. We'll go into more detail on that in future posts and videos.</p>
<h3>Cross Project Views &amp; Filtering</h3>
<p>If we move to the top navigation bar, we see that you can now view data across all projects or by individual projects - a highly requested feature. We then have a quick time period selector, and finally the new filtering system, which allows you to quickly filter your exceptions. We'll show off that feature in it's own video soon.</p>
<h3>Bulk Actions!</h3>
<p>Moving down into the data portion of the view, one feature that actually isn't new is that you can click and drag to select a period of time on the graph. Just a quick pointer there. Something that is new is the ability to select multiple exceptions or instances of an exception and perform bulk actions on it, such as Mark Fixed, Mark Hidden, or Delete. Again, more on that soon.</p>
<h3>Anywhere. Anytime.</h3>
<p>One last quick feature that we thought we would highlight today is that all times are now translated to the user's timezone, so your team members can always be working in their specific time no matter where they are.</p>
<p>That's about it for today, but keep an eye out for more updates as we close in on a release date for Exceptionless 2.0. We know some of these features and enhancements have been on your request list, and we're really excited to be this close to shipping them for you guys.</p>
<p>Until next time, take care!</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2014/2014-10-23-angularjs-exceptionless-2-0/">AngularJS and Exceptionless 2.0</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/AngularJS-large-300x84.png" alt="Angular JS">As we plug away at Exceptionless 2.0, perfecting and future-proofing it, we wanted to stop and take the time to talk about AngularJS, how we are using it in version two, and what benefits we're going to get out of it.</p>
<p>Naturally, we want to maintain all current functionality while supporting planned V2.0 features like search and filtering. We also want it to be static and use the REST API for everything. We're pretty determined to not cheat on that point. Then, thinking ahead, building it to support easily adding new features in the future is a huge priority.</p>
<p>Lets look at these points in a bit more detail.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Static UI</h2>
<p>Using our fully documented REST API, the new Exceptionless 2.0 UI will be static, with no server side logic. What this allows us to do is host the UI on a content delivery network (CDN), guaranteeing faster load times for users anywhere in the world. <strong>Everyone</strong> loves fast load times!</p>
<h2>Much, Much Faster</h2>
<p>Being a single page application (SPA), the new version of the app eliminates page loads. The only thing&nbsp;being loaded is the JSON data, and we can pre-load other content as users navigate the site. That, along with the static UI mentioned above, means we can deliver an app that responds almost instantaneously to the user's input. What a time to be alive.</p>
<h2>Maintainable Modularity</h2>
<p>Version 1 taught us a lot. We gained valuable feedback from users, beat our head against several complex problems, and made countless wish lists for the future. Most of that lead to the desire for a more modular, easily maintainable system that new features could be added to with minimal reinvention.</p>
<p>AngularJS has helped us fulfill those dreams. We can now add new features very easily, without breaking other sections of the site, and our code based has been greatly simplified. And, even with all the modularity, we are still able to run tests on the UI. Pretty snazzy!</p>
<p>Event type support is handled via pluggable view modules, and we'll be able to add new ones that we haven't even conceived of with relative ease.</p>
<h2>Do You Angular?</h2>
<p>Making the choice to go with AngularJS wasn't easy or quick, but be believe it was the right path to take.</p>
<p>Do you Angular? What apps have you used it on? If not, what other frameworks&nbsp;do you use for this type of app, and why?</p>

<p><a title="Bower" href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower </a>is created solely for the front-end and is optimized with that in mind. The biggest difference is that npm does nested dependency tree (size heavy) while Bower requires a flat dependency tree (puts the burden of dependency resolution on the user).</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2014/2014-09-03-making-move-elastic-search-exceptionless-2-0/">Making the Move to Elasticsearch for Exceptionless 2.0</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/Screenshot-2014-09-03-15.03.16.png" alt="Screenshot 2014-09-03 15.03.16">We know you've thought about it when using Exceptionless, and many developers have submitted formal requests. <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
<p>You need it, and we want to provide it. That's why we've decided to integrate Elasticsearch into 2.0, and it's going to be awesome!</p>
<p>Check out a few of the cool things we're going to be able to do with it, below, and let us know what you think!<!--more--></p>
<h2>What Elasticsearch Brings to the Table</h2>
<h3>Simple scaleability</h3>
<p>Moving to <a title="Elasticsearch" href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> for event and stack storage will enable us to simplify many areas of the system, like stats, and also enable us to easily scale the service as it continues to grow.</p>
<h3>Search ALL the things</h3>
<p>The new system will allow users to search by tags, date range, keywords, error type, and more, all while providing full statistics at the same time. This, specifically, has been&nbsp;our most requested feature, and we're glad to finally be able to say it's coming soon!</p>
<h3>Faster, too!</h3>
<p>Elasticsearch removes the need for us to do stats incrementing for every type of view that we want to show. This simplifies the system, further increases performance, and improves throughput for the event collector.</p>
<h3>Statistics everywhere</h3>
<p>You're not just going to get more accurate stats within Exceptionless, you're going to get them in real time, and we'll be able to display them in multiple time zones, too.</p>
<h3>Future-proofing</h3>
<p>Instead of having to think of everything up front while we're building Exceptionless 2.0, Elasticsearch will enable us to provide new insights in the future, something every developer dreams of!</p>
<h2>We Hope You're as Stoked as We Are</h2>
<p>Search has been a long time coming for&nbsp;Exceptionless, and we're super excited to be able to provide a robust, thorough, scaleable solution that will cover 99.99% of possible use cases. Hang in there - we're coding it in as fast as we can!</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2014/2014-08-21-case-study-server-expiration-error-pre-alpha-game-release/">Case Study: Server Expiration Error for Pre-Alpha Game Release</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/game-post.jpg" alt="game-post">Today we've got a pretty cool case study that comes to us from a game development studio!</p>
<p>We love to see Exceptionless being used by companies with interesting projects and development pipelines, and what's more interesting than gaming, multi-server, and multi-player environments?</p>
<p>These guys also gave us some good feedback, which we'll address.</p>
<p>Check it out!<!--more--></p>
<h2>Project</h2>
<p>This user is working on a pre-alpha game that is, at the time of the feedback, only available to the in-house team. The game environment requires multiple servers that are deployed via script. When an old version of a server comes down and a new one is deployed, there is cleanup that must happen, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I like your product! I've previously written an exception-reporting system that did the same type of thing as Exceptionless but used a mail-server as the exception repository. Since that system was something I had to leave behind at my last company, I wanted to find a solution for my current company, and after comparing alternatives liked what your team had built, so that's what we're using now."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How Exceptionless Helped</h2>
<p>Because the game had&nbsp;such&nbsp;limited players, servers, and testing, it's tough to catch all the little bugs. Fortunately, Exceptionless was able to catch a potentially huge bug that would cause old versions of the servers that were still running to crash because of files being deleted by the new server development clean up scripts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If an old version was still running it would crash because its data-files got deleted. Since we're still in development mode there aren't enough people playing on our game servers to notice this exception - but we would have when going into alpha or beta test! Fortunately Exceptionless did notice and report this problem."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think that's pretty awesome, and not just because we're huge nerds!</p>
<h2>Feature Requests &amp; Thoughts</h2>
<p>We were lucky enough to get some great feedback from these guys, as well.</p>
<h3>Bug Ownership</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #282f33;">"We'd like a feature that allows our developers to claim ownership of bugs so that they're not seen by others in the Dashboard view by default."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With multiple developers on multiple projects, bugs can stack up and things can get messy. John doesn't need to see Billy's bugs from project A when he's working on his own bugs for project B.</p>
<p>We definitely agree here and understand, but&nbsp;<span style="color: #282f33;">there is a fine line between us being an error reporting service and getting into <a href="/website/bug-tracking/">bug tracking</a> type features. We had a previous product that tried to do too much and turned people off so we really wanted to try and keep Exceptionless simple. That being said, <strong>we want to make Exceptionless integrate with other apps</strong> much more in the future and make it really easy to create new integrations. We're working on this now with <a title="Upcoming Exceptionless Version 2.0 Overview &amp; Review" href="/website/upcoming-exceptionless-version-2-0-overview-review/">Exceptionless 2.0, coming soon</a>!</span></p>
<h3>Multiple Services on Single Server</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"<span style="color: #282f33;">One other thing that was painful for me personally: we run multiple services of the same type on a single server (e.g. multiple instances of "game-server.exe"). In order to ensure that each server has its own queue folder and logfile, I had to write a chunk of custom code."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, we totally agree!&nbsp;<span style="color: #282f33;">The <a title="Exceptionless 2.0 Client Rewrite Sneak Peek Usage Example" href="/website/exceptionless-2-0-client-rewrite-sneak-peek-usage-example/">client in Exceptionless 2.0</a> will be MUCH simpler and will make things much easier. You will be able to easily use in-memory storage and be able to plug in different storage implementations.</span></p>
<h2>We Love Feedback!</h2>
<p>If you're a current user, we'd love to hear how you've used Exceptionless to cut down on bugs and build better apps. If you've got any criticisms or feature feedback/requests, keep those coming as well - they help us improve!</p>
<p>Have an awesome day!</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2014/2014-08-07-new-price-plans-medium-large-teamsprojects/">New Price Plans for Medium to Large Teams/Projects</a></h2>
    <p>We've had quite a few requests for pricing plans that support users, retention, and errors somewhere between our old medium and enterprise plans, so we crunched the numbers and came up with new large and extra large plans that find a happy medium.</p>
<p>Both plans include more users, more retention, and more errors. Check out the details on each&nbsp;package below or <a href="/website/pricing/" title="Pricing Plans">view the Pricing Page</a> for a quick summary.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Free</h2>
<p>The free plan, which is great for trying things out or super small personal projects, includes provisions for <strong>one project, one user, three days of error retention, and three thousand errors per month</strong>.</p>
<p>It does not include premium features such as advanced notifications, web hooks, and other future premium features.</p>
<h2>Small - $15</h2>
<p>For $15 per month, you get <strong>five projects, ten users, thirty days of retention, 15,000 errors per month</strong>, and premium features.</p>
<h2>Medium - $49</h2>
<p>The medium Exceptionless plan offers <strong>fifteen projects and twenty-five users</strong>. You get <strong>ninety days of retention, 75,000 errors per month</strong>, and premium features.</p>
<h2>Large Plan - $99&nbsp;<em>(new)</em></h2>
<p>The large plan is new, and includes <strong>unlimited projects and users, 180 days of error retention, 250,000 errors per month</strong>, and premium features.</p>
<p>This is quickly becoming a popular plan and makes sense for a lot of medium to medium-large teams and projects.</p>
<h2>Extra Large - $199&nbsp;<em>(new)</em></h2>
<p>The extra large plan was created to bridge the gap between large and enterprise by quadrupling the <strong>number of errors per month to 1,000,000</strong>. You still get unlimited projects and users, as well as 180 days of retention and premium features.</p>
<h2>Enterprise - $499</h2>
<p>For those businesses and enterprise-level teams that have several large projects and need to handle huge&nbsp;numbers of errors, the Enterprise plan offers everything that the Extra Large plan offers, with <strong>3,000,000 errors per month</strong>.</p>
<h2>Custom</h2>
<p>And, of course, should you need to customize a plan to handle even more errors, we can always get you taken care of, just let us know!</p>
