Thousands, if not millions, of exceptions are thrown every day <strong>in production code</strong> without anyone knowing. These errors might be affecting the bottom line, or they could be negligible - either way, it's important to know that they exist, how often they are occurring, and what parts of the app are affected.</p>
<p>Are you looking for a comprehensive tool that handles logging, reporting, grouping, and notifications for exceptions in your ASP.NET, Web API, WebForms, WPF, Console, MVC, or NancyFX app? Exceptionless does all that, and more. Lets take a look.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Who is Exceptionless for?</h2>
<p>Exceptionless is for developers and dev teams that want to have enhanced visibility of errors, track down bugs faster, tighten up code, and produce a better overall product for the end user.</p>
<p>Currently, the platform is .NET based and has client support for ASP.NET, Web API, WebForms, WPF, Console, MFC, and NancyFX. Soon, we will support clients for JavaScript, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Java, Python, and more.

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2014/2014-04-11-intelligent-app-error-grouping-helps-organize-exceptions/">Intelligent App Error Grouping Helps Organize Your Exceptions</a></h2>
    <p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4831" alt="Exception Grouping Totals" src="/website/assets/img/news/thumbnail.png" width="164" height="120" data-id="4831">Having a tool like Exceptionless to report and log your software's errors is great, but many of our clients experience thousands of instances of each error over various lengths of time, which can become overwhelming quickly.</p>
<p>We couldn't just leave them with a huge list of individual error occurrences to drudge through, so we went through several different potential options until we devised the best way to group them.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Grouping Errors Intelligently</h2>
<h3>What's there to group by?</h3>
<ol>
<li>The details we provide on each error give us countless ways to group them. While some wouldn't make sense, we considered everything.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Type</li>
<li>Message</li>
<li>Platform</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Browser information</li>
<li>User information</li>
<li>Environment information</li>
<li>Request details</li>
<li>and more...</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drill down fast</h3>
<p>Since we use Exceptionless to report and track down our own bugs, it was easy to put ourselves in our own shoes and think about what would allow us to drill down and fix errors quickly.</p>
<p>With that mindset, we decided that there were two important error details that should be used for grouping.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Where the error occurred</strong>
We felt that, first and foremost, we wanted to know where the error was occurring. Even though there is a possibility it might be occurring in multiple locations, we felt that each location represented its own importance in our grouping scheme.</li>
<li><strong>Type of error</strong>
The type of error is also very important, and we felt that when you combine type with location, you get a set of errors that holds enough significant explicit data to be recognized as a group.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What Grouping Allows Us to Do</h2>
<p>When we group app errors by location and type, it allows us to report error instance counts, first occurrences, frequency of occurrence, and most recent occurrence on the dashboard.</p><figure id="attachment_4823" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 150px"><p></p>
<p><a href="/website/assets/group-details.png"><img src="/website/assets/img/news/dashboard-home-150x150.png" alt="Error Group Details"></a></p><figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">Error Group Details</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<div style="clear: both;">
</div>
<p>This seemingly basic grouping forms the basis for the different Exceptionless dashboard tabs and pages, thus becoming a major cornerstone for the platform. Click into a group, and you see the title, exception type, and location, along with a graph of occurrences and the most recent occurrences.</p>
<p>From there, you can drill down into each occurrence and scrutinize all of the <a href="/website/whats-included-exceptionless-detailed-error-reports/" title="Error Report Details">error's details</a>.</p>
<p>That's how we do it! Any questions? Let us know.</p>

    <p><a href="/website/assets/img/logo1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4531" style="margin: 10px;" alt="Microsoft Azure" src="/website/assets/img/news/logo1.png" width="165" height="21" data-id="4531"></a>As usual, we've been working on ways to improve the Exceptionless service.</p>
<p>Due to growing demand for our hosted error reporting plans, we decided to move everything to the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform.</p>
<p>We completed the move last week and, except for a few small hiccups that were quickly resolved, everything is already running faster across the board!</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Benefits of Azure</h2>
<h3>Bring on the errors!</h3>
<p>As our user base continues to expand, the first priority is to continue providing the best service possible. Azure allows us to guarantee scalability, and has already proven to be&nbsp;<strong>much</strong> faster and more responsive. We're ready for whatever you can throw at us.</p>
<h3>Focus</h3>
<p>Developing infrastructure takes time, and we would rather be developing the code behind Exceptionless. The move to Azure allows us to do just that, taking a lot off our plate in terms of hosting. It's pretty awesome.</p>
<h3>Future Azure partner</h3>
<p>In the future, we would like to become an Azure partner and be listed as one of the approved store add-ons. We're not there yet, because we've got to go through the application process, etc, etc, but it's in the works!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Azure is an open and flexible cloud platform that enables you to quickly build, deploy and manage applications across a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. You can build applications using any language, tool or framework. And you can integrate your public cloud applications with your existing IT environment." - Microsoft Azure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are happy with the move and think it means great things for the future of Exceptionless. We hope our users appreciate the speed and responsiveness, and can see the improvements in service.</p>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2014/2014-03-26-whats-included-exceptionless-detailed-error-reports/">Detailed Error Reports - What's Included?</a></h2>
    <p>When an error occurs in your app, you need to know the critical details, fast, so you can drill down and fix it. We get it - we're developers too - that's why we built Exceptionless.</p>
<p>The trick was organizing the data so it didn't overwhelm our users, while still providing all the important stuff so developers wouldn't have to spend extra time tracking down versions, requesting stack traces, or pulling teeth to get environment information.</p>
<p>Lets take a look at the&nbsp;<strong>default</strong> information included with every error. We say default because you can easily <strong>add your own</strong> information with custom objects.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Each Error Occurrence</h2>
<p>Every single error occurrence has the following tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview</li>
<li>Exception</li>
<li>Request</li>
<li>Environment</li>
</ul>
<p>On each of these, you can go to the previous or next occurrence for easy comparison.</p>
<p>Lets take a closer look at each tab.</p>
<h3>Error Overview</h3>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/error-overview-tab-248x300.jpg" alt="Exception Reporting Overview"></p>
<p>The overview tab holds general information for that occurrence, including the variables below. Sometimes this is all you'll need to track down the bug. Sometimes you'll need to dig deeper.</p>
<ul>
<li>Occurred On</li>
<li>Error Type</li>
<li>Message</li>
<li>Platform</li>
<li>URL</li>
<li>Referrer</li>
<li>Browser</li>
<li>Browser OS</li>
<li>User Name</li>
<li>Stack Trace</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exception Tab</h3>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/error-exception-tab.jpg" alt="Exceptionless Exception Details"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  On the exception tab, we reference the timestamp, error type, message, and stack trace, while also providing you with all of the loaded modules, including versions.
</p>
<h3 style="clear: both;">
  Request Tab
</h3>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/error-request-tab-225x300.jpg" alt="Exceptionless Request Details"></p>
<p>Here we have tons of important request info:</p>
<ul>
<li>Occurred On</li>
<li>HTTP Method</li>
<li>URL</li>
<li>Referrer</li>
<li>Client IP</li>
<li>User Agent</li>
<li>Browser</li>
<li>Browser OS</li>
<li>Device</li>
<li>Is Known Bot</li>
<li>Cookie Values</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="clear: both;">
  Environment Tab
</h3>
<p><img src="/website/assets/img/news/error-environment-tab.jpg" alt="Exceptionless Environment Details"></p>
<p>Environment isn't something that we always think about, but in some cases it can tell us a lot about the exception. We've got you covered!</p>
<ul>
<li>Occurred On</li>
<li>Machine Name</li>
<li>IP Address</li>
<li>Processor Count</li>
<li>Total Memory</li>
<li>Available Memory</li>
<li>Process Memory</li>
<li>OS Name</li>
<li>OS Version</li>
<li>Architecture</li>
<li>Runtime Version</li>
<li>Process ID</li>
<li>Process Name</li>
<li>Command Line</li>
<li>Client Information
<ul>
<li>Install Date</li>
<li>Version</li>
<li>Platform</li>
<li>Submission Method</li>
<li>Application Starts</li>
<li>Errors Submitted</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Did We Do?</h2>
<p>We have done our best to include all the important information in an organized, easy to read, intuitive interface. Think we're missing something? Think we can organize it differently? Let us know! We love feedback.</p>

    <p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3789" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;" alt="8 million errors reported" src="/website/assets/img/news/8-million-errors.png" width="174" height="155" data-id="3789">Just over six months ago, we launched Exceptionless with a mission to impact the coding community in a positive way. The goal was, and still is, to help developers find, track, and squash errors, ultimately creating better code for users.</p>
<p>A few days ago we officially hit <strong>1000 accounts</strong>, and as of today Exceptionless has reported <strong>8,562,499 errors</strong>! We couldn't be more excited!<!--more--></p>
<p>Sure, we're busier than ever now, answering emails, conversing with open source contributors on new features, and working on new features ourselves, but seeing something grow this quickly, that we've put so much work into, leaves us with little room to complain. The only real thing we can do is say thank you.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>We'd like to thank all of our users for using the service, providing feedback, asking the hard questions that make us realize we need to make tweaks here and there, and providing us with direction.</p>
<p>Also, we would specifically like to thank our beta testers that were with us from the beginning. You know who you are, and without you Exceptionless simply would not be the tool it is today.</p>
<p>And, of course, we have to thank everyone that has contributed to and forked the project since <a href="/website/fork-us-exceptionless-goes-open-source/" title="Exceptionless Goes Open Source">we went open source</a> a few weeks ago. 39 forks, 124 <a title="Exceptionless on GitHub" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless" target="_blank">GitHub </a>stars, and a NancyFX client so far - not bad!</p>
<h2>But Wait, There's More!</h2>
<p>They say there's no sleep for the wicked, so we're feverishly working on a few major things that will have big long-term benefits for the app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving to Azure for faster, more robust, scaleable hosting</li>
<li>Simplifying the API to make it easier for new clients to be implemented and improve metric reporting</li>
<li>JavaScript client</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg, of course. The to-do list is ever-growing, but we've got to start somewhere.</p>
<h3>Let us know what you think</h3>
<p>If you are just now joining the Exceptionless community, let us know what you think. Love it or hate it, we want to know why and how to improve.</p>
<p>Happy bug hunting!</p>

<p>Luisrudge has become the first non-trivial contributor to the Exceptionless real-time error reporting project on GitHub, with his NancyFX integration.</p>
<p>If you're a NancyFX user, you can find the <a title="Exceptionless NancyFX package on NuGet" href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/Exceptionless.Nancy/" target="_blank">Nancy package</a> in our NuGet gallery.</p>
<p>As a token of our appreciation, Luis received a free year of hosting! Thanks again Luis! Read more about contributing and getting free hosting below.<!--more--></p>
<h2>What's NancyFX?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono. The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Built from the ground up (not simply a DSL on another framework)</li>
<li>Removed underlying framework limitations and feature hacks</li>
<li>Removed need to reference assemblies you don't need, keeping things light</li>
<li>Ability to run anywhere, including ASP.NET/IIS, WCF, self hosted, and any OWIN out of the box</li>
<li>Super lightweight action declarations&nbsp;for GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS and PATCH requests</li>
<li>View engine integration for Spark, Razor, dotLiquid, SuperSimpleViewEngine, and others</li>
<li>Request path matching with advanced parameter capabilities, plus the ability to replace the path matching strategy with custom implementations for your needs</li>
<li>Easy response syntax, enabling you to return things like int, string, HttpStatusCode and Action elements without having to explicitly cast or wrap your response - you just return it and Nancy will do the work for you</li>
<li>A powerful, light-weight, testing framework to help you verify the behavior of your application</li>
<li>Content negotiation</li>
<li>And more...</li>

    <h2><a href="/website/news/2014/2014-02-18-fork-us-exceptionless-goes-open-source/">Fork Us! Exceptionless Goes Open Source</a></h2>
    <p><strong><img src="/website/assets/img/news/Octocat-300x249.png" alt="GitHub Octocat">It's a big day at Exceptionless.</strong></p>
<p>We are super excited to announce that we are <a title="Exceptionless on GitHub" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless" target="_blank">open sourcing the Exceptionless code</a>! That's right, now you can hack on our real-time error reporting tool yourself.</p>
<p>Too many apps are throwing too many errors out there, resulting in confused users, lost business, and endless frustration.</p>
<p>We believe Exceptionless can help the development community become more in-tune with their code by making those errors more transparent, trackable, and squashable. More importantly, we want to support developers building and shipping better code for their <strong>users</strong>.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Cool, Where Do I Start?</h2>
<p>Check out the <a title="Exceptionless on GitHub" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless" target="_blank">Exceptionless Github Repository</a>, and make sure to <a title="Contributing to Exceptionless" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">read about contributing</a> if you plan on helping us improve the project.</p>
<p>You'll find instructions on getting started there, including setting up your hosting environment if you want to host things yourself. If you would rather host with us, we offer <a href="/website/pricing/">easy and affordable plans</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a feature request or issue, let us know on the <a title="Exceptionless Issue Tracker" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>. We are <strong>100% committed</strong> to supporting the project.</p>
<h2>Why Open Source?</h2>
<p>In short, we want to see what the community can do with our baby, which we consider a great development tool. The open source movement has provided innovation throughout the industry, and we cannot tell you how excited we are to be a part of it.</p>
<p>We hope you will take it, add to it, suggest great new features, and report bugs, but most of all we hope you will use it to <strong>build better apps for the world</strong>.</p>
<p>The Exceptionless Team will continue to work on a road map of features and improvements, all while providing support to developers that want to contribute.</p>
<h3>Planned features/enhancements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Refactor client so that the base client is a PCL library thus supporting WinRT and Mono.</li>
<li>Implement search features using ElasticSearch.</li>
<li>JavaScript client for reporting client side errors.</li>
<li>Refactor the API and UI to be completely separate layers and rewrite the UI as a SPA app using AngularJS.</li>
<li>Add a server side plugin system that allows new functionality to be easily added like HipChat notifications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ideas for the community</h3>
<p>These include just a few of feature requests, etc, that aren't in the team's immediate pipeline that you might consider tackling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients for Ruby, Java, Python, PHP, etc</li>
<li>Ability to log non-exception data</li>
<li>Teams within organizations</li>
<li>Bookmarks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lets make something awesome</h3>
<p>We have spent a lot of time on Exceptionless, but together with the community we can take it to the next level. Check out the <a title="Exceptionless on GitHub" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> today, and happy coding!</p>
<p><strong>Watch out, exceptions!</strong></p>
