## Creating New Posts  

You can manually create a new markdown file for your posts and ensure the front matter is correct, or you can run the following command from within the project directory: 

`node new_post.js -t ${YOUR TITLE}`  

The title should be wrapped in quotes like this: 

`node new_post.js -t "This is a Test Post"`
