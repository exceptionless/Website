<h1>RequestCore</h1>
<p>RequestCore is a lightweight cURL-based HTTP request/response class that leverages MultiCurl for parallel requests.</p>
<h3>PEAR HTTP_Request?</h3>
<p>RequestCore was written as a replacement for <a href="http://pear.php.net/http_request/">PEAR HTTP_Request</a>. While PEAR HTTP_Request is full-featured and heavy, RequestCore features only the essentials and is very lightweight. It also leverages the batch request support in cURL's <code>curl_multi_exec()</code> to enable multi-threaded requests that fire in parallel.</p>
